{"question": "What is the expected contribution of N5 to TSMC's wafer revenue in 2021?", "answer": " The expected contribution of N5 to TSMC's wafer revenue in 2021 is around 20%.", "date": "Apr 15, 2021, 2:00 a.m. ET", "transcript": " water shortage at different stages. We will continue our collaborative effort with the government and the private sector and water conservation, and new water sources. We saw a comprehensive enterprise risk management system. We do not expect to see any material impact to our operations.\nFinally, I will talk about N5 and industry status. TSMC's N5 is foundry industry's most advanced solution, with the best of PPA. N5 is already in the second year of volume production, with yield better than our original plan. N5 demand continued to be strong, driven by smartphone and HPC applications, and we expect N5 to contribute around 20% of our wafer revenue in 2021. N4 leveraged the strong foundation of N5, to further extend our 5-nanometer family. N4 is a straightforward migration from N5, with compatible design rules, while providing further performance, power and density enhancement for the next wave of 5-nanometer products. N4's production is targeted for second half this year, and volume production in 2022. Thus we expect demand for our N5 family to continue to grow in the next several years, driven by the robust demand for smartphone and HPC applications.\nN3 we will be another four node stride from our N5, and will use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance, and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track with good progress. We continue to see a much higher level of customer engagement for both HPC and smartphone applications at N3, as compared with the N5 and N3 at a similar stage.\nRisk production is scheduled in 2021. The volume production is targeted in second half of 2022. Our 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced foundry technology in both PPA and transistor technology, when it is introduced. Thus we are confident, that both our 5-nanometer and 3 nanometer will be large and long lasting nodes for TSMC.\nThis concludes our key message.

{"question": "What is TSMC forecast for foundry industry growth in 2021 in U.S. dollar terms ", "answer": " TSMC's forecast for the foundry industry growth in 2021 in U.S. dollar terms is around 16%.", "date": "Apr 15, 2021, 2:00 a.m. ET", "transcript": ". For the full year of 2021, we now forecast the overall semiconductor market excluding memory, to grow about 12%, while foundry industry growth is forecast to be about 16%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow by around 20% in 2021 in U.S. dollar terms.\nNext, let me talk about our capital budget for this year. Every year, our capex is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As we enter a period of higher growth, underpinned by the multi-year structural megatrends of 5G related and HPC applications, we believe a higher level of capital investment is necessary to capture the future growth opportunities. In order to meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies in the next several years, we have decided to raise our full-year 2021 capex to be around $30 billion. About 80% of the 2021 capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making, and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies.\nNow, let me turn the microphone over to C. C.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Wendall. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First let me talk about the capacity shortage and demand outlook. Our customers are currently facing challenges from the industry wide semiconductor capacity shortage, which is driven by both structural increase in long-term demand, as well as short-term imbalance in the supply chain. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand, as a multi-year megatrend of 5G and HPC related applications are expected to fuel strong demand for our revised technologies in the next several years. COVID-19 has also fundamentally accelerated the digital transformation, making semiconductors more pervasive than essential in people's life. In addition, the need to ensure supply security is creating short-term imbalance in the supply chain, driven by supply chain disruption, due to COVID-19 and uncertainties brought about by geopolitical tensions.\nNow let me talk about TSMC's investment plan and disciplines. TSMC's submission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logica IC industry for years to come. In order to support our customers of course, TSMC is taking several actions to help adjust the capacity shortage for our customers. We are working hard to increase our productivity, to drive more output, to help support our customers for the near term.\nTo address the structural increase in the long-term demand profile. We are working closely with our customers, and investing to support the demand. We have acquired land and component, and started the construction of new facilities. We are hiring thousands of employees and expanding our capacity at multiple sites. TSMC expects to invest about $100 billion over the next three years to increase capacity, to support the manufacturing in R&D of leading edge and specialty technologies. Increase capacity expected to improve supply certainty for our customers and have strengthened confidence in global supply chains that rely on semiconductors.\nOur capital investment decision based on four disciplines; technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning the proper return. At the same time, we faced manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading node. New investment in mature nodes, and rising material costs. Therefore, we are continuing to work closely with customers, to see our value. Our value improves the value of our technology, the value of our service and the value of our capacity support to customers.\nWe are looking to firm up our wafer pricing to a reasonable level.

Every year, our capex is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in future years. As we enter a period of higher growth, underpinned by the multi-year structural megatrends of 5G related and HPC applications, we believe a higher level of capital investment is necessary to capture the future growth opportunities. In order to meet the increasing demand for our advanced and specialty technologies in the next several years, we have decided to raise our full-year 2021 capex to be around $30 billion. About 80% of the 2021 capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 3-nanometer 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer about 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mask making, and about 10% will be spent for specialty technologies.\nNow, let me turn the microphone over to C. C.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Wendall. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First let me talk about the capacity shortage and demand outlook. Our customers are currently facing challenges from the industry wide semiconductor capacity shortage, which is driven by both structural increase in long-term demand, as well as short-term imbalance in the supply chain. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand, as a multi-year megatrend of 5G and HPC related applications are expected to fuel strong demand for our revised technologies in the next several years. COVID-19 has also fundamentally accelerated the digital transformation, making semiconductors more pervasive than essential in people's life. In addition, the need to ensure supply security is creating short-term imbalance in the supply chain, driven by supply chain disruption, due to COVID-19 and uncertainties brought about by geopolitical tensions.\nNow let me talk about TSMC's investment plan and disciplines. TSMC's submission is to be the trusted technology and capacity provider for the global logica IC industry for years to come. In order to support our customers of course, TSMC is taking several actions to help adjust the capacity shortage for our customers. We are working hard to increase our productivity, to drive more output, to help support our customers for the near term.\nTo address the structural increase in the long-term demand profile. We are working closely with our customers, and investing to support the demand. We have acquired land and component, and started the construction of new facilities. We are hiring thousands of employees and expanding our capacity at multiple sites. TSMC expects to invest about $100 billion over the next three years to increase capacity, to support the manufacturing in R&D of leading edge and specialty technologies. Increase capacity expected to improve supply certainty for our customers and have strengthened confidence in global supply chains that rely on semiconductors.\nOur capital investment decision based on four disciplines; technology leadership, flexible and responsive manufacturing, retaining customers' trust and earning the proper return. At the same time, we faced manufacturing cost challenges due to increasing process complexity at leading node. New investment in mature nodes, and rising material costs. Therefore, we are continuing to work closely with customers, to see our value. Our value improves the value of our technology, the value of our service and the value of our capacity support to customers.\nWe are looking to firm up our wafer pricing to a reasonable level.

The automotive supply chain was affected throughout the year, and our customers continue to reduce their demand, throughout the third quarter of 2020. We only began to see sudden recovery in the fourth quarter of 2020. However the automotive supply chain is long and complex, which is on inventory management practices. From chip production to car production, it takes at least six months with several tiers of suppliers in between. TSMC is doing its part to address the chip supply challenges for our customers.\nIn January of this year, TSMC announced that capacity support for automotive customers is our top priority. Since then, we have worked dynamically with our other customer, to reallocate our wafer capacity to support the worldwide automotive industry. However, the shortage further deteriorated due to the unexpected snowstorm in Texas, and a fab manufacturing disruption in Japan. Together with our productivity improvement, we expect the automotive component shortage from semiconductor to be greatly reduced for TSMC's customer by the next quarter.\nNow I will talk about Taiwan water supply update. The water supply in Taiwan is currently tight, due to the lack of rainfall in the past year. We have been prepared for this. TSMC has a long established enterprise risk management system in place, which cover water supply risk as well. Through our existing water conservation measure, we are able to manage the current water usage reduction requirement from the government, with no impact on our operations.

Thus, even as we shoulder a greater burden of capex investment for the industry, we can continue to invest to support our customers' growth and deliver long-term profitable growth for our shareholders.\nNow I will talk about N5 and N4P and N4X status. As our N5 enter its third year of ramp, demand continues to be very strong, driven by smartphone and HPC applications. Our N5 has proven to be the industry's most competitive leading-edge technology. To further enhance our N5 family's performance, power, and density improvement for next-wave 5-nanometer products, we also introduced the N4P and N4X technologies.\nN4P offers 11% performance boost as compared to the N5 with 22% improvement in power efficiency and 6% density gain. N4P is designed for easy migration from N5 with its products taking our schedule for second half 2022. We also introduced N4X as an offering especially optimized for workload-intensive HPC applications. N4X will offer much more circuit performance boost over N5 and we expect it to enter its production in first half 2023.\nWith our continuous enhancement of our N5 process technologies, we expect demand for our N5 family to continue to grow in the next several years, and for N5 family to be a large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Next, let me talk about the N3 and N3E status, our N3 technology wide-use FinFET transistor structure to deliver the best technology maturity, performance and cost for our customers. Our N3 technology development is on track. We have developed complete performance support for both HPC and the smartphone applications.\nN3 production will start in second half of 2022.

Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them.\nThe first one is, when I look at your full year guidance of 35% revenue growth, it looks like calendar 4Q or the December quarter is going to be sequentially down more than 10%. And that hasn't happened in a long time. So I'm kind of curious, how much of that is driven by demand versus FX? And then the second question, a follow-up is, if I look at your capex run rate, the first half is running at about NT 17 billion, which is below the lower end of your full-year guidance. So I'm kind of curious, what are the tool delays that's causing the pushout of capex into next year? Is it like EUV? Is it like depth edge tools? Any color on that would be super helpful.\nJeff Su\nOK. So Krish has two questions. First is looking at our full-year guidance to grow mid-30s, and he says this implies a decline in the fourth quarter?\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo. I don't think so. We did the calculation. Maybe you can do that again.\nIt's at least up.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Krish, I would note that when we talk about mid-30s guidance, as C.C. said, that is in U.S. dollar terms.\nOK?\nJeff Su\nAnd then his second question is on capex and sort of looking at the capex. His question is we have already said it will be closer to the lower end of the range. He wants to know what is driving the capex? Is it tool delays? Is it EUV? What types of equipment?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNo. I don't think we can go into that kind of details. But some of them got pushed out to next year, as C.C. mentioned.\nAnd every year, the capex profile can be difference quarter by quarter.\nJeff Su\nYeah. OK.\nKrish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nJeff Su\nOK. Thank you.

The next one to ask questions, Frank Lee from HSBC.\nFrank Lee -- HSBC -- Analyst\nThank you. I wanted to just ask a question on, I guess, the overall profitability and also pricing. It seems like this year, we start to see a foundry price increase and a bit unusual for TSMC. And going into next year, it looks like there's some manifestation of further price increases.\nBut at the same time, we're also seeing potentially inventory correction. So just trying to understand the pricing strategy itself, is this more of a reflection of perhaps the structural profitability for this cycle being different than the past? Or are there any kind of cost that we're seeing this time that we haven't seen in past cycles.\nJeff Su\nOK. So Frank's first question is on pricing.

We did the calculation. Maybe you can do that again.\nIt's at least up.\nWendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Krish, I would note that when we talk about mid-30s guidance, as C.C. said, that is in U.S. dollar terms.\nOK?\nJeff Su\nAnd then his second question is on capex and sort of looking at the capex. His question is we have already said it will be closer to the lower end of the range. He wants to know what is driving the capex? Is it tool delays? Is it EUV? What types of equipment?\nWendell Huang -- Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNo. I don't think we can go into that kind of details. But some of them got pushed out to next year, as C.C. mentioned.\nAnd every year, the capex profile can be difference quarter by quarter.\nJeff Su\nYeah. OK.\nKrish Sankar -- Cowen and Company -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you very much. Thank you.\nJeff Su\nOK. Thank you.

It seems like this year, we start to see a foundry price increase and a bit unusual for TSMC. And going into next year, it looks like there's some manifestation of further price increases.\nBut at the same time, we're also seeing potentially inventory correction. So just trying to understand the pricing strategy itself, is this more of a reflection of perhaps the structural profitability for this cycle being different than the past? Or are there any kind of cost that we're seeing this time that we haven't seen in past cycles.\nJeff Su\nOK. So Frank's first question is on pricing.

TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery.\nWe are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues.

However, like many other industries, our suppliers have been facing greater challenges in their supply chains, which are extending toward delivery lead times for both advanced and mature nodes.\nAs a result, we expect some of our capex this year to be pushed out into 2023. TSMC is actively doing its part to help our tool suppliers address the supply chain challenges. In April, we said that we have increased regular high-level communications to trace the progress and send several teams on site to support our suppliers. Since then, we have worked closely to identify critical chips that are gauging toward delivery.\nWe are working dynamically with our customers and prioritize our wafer capacity to support these critical chips to help mitigate the chip constant issues. While challenges remain, the situation is improving. We do not expect any impact to our 2022 capacity plan. And we are able to put in the delivery schedule for certain amount of tools for our 2023 capacity.\nWe have been working closely with our customer for 2023 so that we can support their demand. Now let me talk about the N3 and N3 status. Our N3 is on track for volume production in second half of this year with Goodyear. We expect revenue contribution starting first half of 2023, with a smooth ramp in 2023, driven by both HPC and smartphone applications.\nN3 will further extend our N3 family with the enhanced performance, power and yield. N3 will offer complete platform support for both smartphone and HPC applications. We observed a high level of customer engagement at N3. And volume production is scheduled for around one year after N3.\nOur 3-nanometer technology will be the most advanced semiconductor technology in both PPA and transistor technology when it is introduced. Thus, we are confident that our N3 family will be another large and long-lasting node for TSMC. Finally, let me talk about the N2 status. Our N2 technology development is on track and progressing well to our expectation, with risk production schedule in 2024 and volume production in 2025.\nAfter careful evaluation and extensive period of development, our 2-nanometer technology will adopt the narrow sea transistor structure to provide our customers with the best performance, cost and technology maturity. N2 deliver full node performance and power benefited to address the increasing need for energy-efficient computing, with 10 to 15-speed improvement at the same or 20% to 30% power improvement at the same speed and larger density of more than 20% increase as compared with N3e.

This concludes my financial presentation.\nNow I will move on to key messages. I will start by making some comments on our 2022 capital budget and depreciation. Every year, our capex is spent in anticipation of the growth that will follow in the future years. We are witnessing a structural increase in underlying semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry mega trends of 5G-related and HPC applications.\nIn 2021, we spent USD 30 billion to capture the strong demand and support our customers' growth. In 2022, our capital budget is expected to be between USD 40 million to USD 44 billion. Out of the USD 40 billion to USD 44 billion capex for 2022, between 70% and 80% of the capital budget will be allocated for advanced process technologies, including 2-nanometer, 3-nanometer, 5-nanometer and 7-nanometer. About 10% will be spent for advanced packaging and mass making and 10% to 20% will be spent for specialty technologies.\nOur depreciation expense is expected to increase by low to mid-teens percentage year over year in 2022 as newly incurred depreciation will be partially offset by other notes rolling off depreciation. With this level of capex spending in 2022, we reiterate that TSMC remains committed to sustainable cash dividends on both an annual and quarterly basis. Now let me turn the microphone over to C.C.\nC.C. Wei -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Wendell. We hope everybody is staying safe and healthy during this time. First, let me start with our 2022 outlook. We expect 2022 to be another strong growth year for TSMC.\nFor the full year of 2022, we forecast the overall semiconductor market, excluding memory, to grow approximately 9% while foundry industry growth is forecast to be close to 20%. For TSMC, we are confident we can outperform the foundry revenue growth and grow between mid- to high 20s percent in 2022 in US dollar term. Our 2022 business will be fueled by strong demand for our industry-leading advanced and specialty technologies, where we see strong interest from all four growth platforms, which are smartphone, HPC, IoT, and automotive. Entering 2022, we expect the supply chain to maintain a higher level of inventory as compared to the historical seasonal level given the industry's continued need to ensure supply security.\nWhile the short-term imbalance may or may not persist, we continue to observe the structural increase in long-term semiconductor demand underpinned by the industry mega trend of 5G and HPC-related applications. We also observed the higher silicon content in many end devices, including automotive, PCs, servers, networking, and smartphones. As a result, we expect our capacity to remain tight throughout 2022 as we believe our technology leadership will enable TSMC to capture the strong demand for our advanced and specialty technologies. Next, let me talk about TSMC's long-term growth outlook and profitability.\nWe are entering a period of higher structural growth. As the technology becomes more pervasive and essential in people's lives, and the digital transformation accelerates, the semiconductor industry value in supply chain is increasing. As we embark upon the 5G era, an intelligent and more connected world will fuel a massive requirement for computation power and prepare greater need for energy-efficient computing, which demand greater use of leading-edge technologies. The multiyear mega trend of 5G and HPC-related applications will drive multiunit volume growth and more importantly, spur substantial semiconductor content enrichment in HPC, smartphone, automotive, and IoT applications to address the structural increase in the long-term market demand profile.\nTSMC is working closely with our customers to plan our capacity and investing in leading-edge and specialty technology to support their group demand.
