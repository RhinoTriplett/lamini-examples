My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo second-quarter 2021 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our second-quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie. \nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John. Good morning. I'll make some brief comments about our second-quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second-quarter results in more detail.\nLet me start with the second quarter. We earned $6 billion or $1.38 per common share in the second quarter. These results included $1.6 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses as credit quality continued to outperform our expectations. Charge-offs continue to decline as the economy continues to improve and our customers continue to have high levels of liquidity.\nRevenue increased compared with the first quarter. While net interest income was stable, we had sizable gains from equity securities, and card and deposit-related fees increased, reflecting increased spending. Expenses declined, reflecting a decline in personnel expense, which is typically highest in the first quarter, and progress on our efficiency initiatives. If you look through the reserve release and outsized gains from equity securities, we are pleased that our results continue to show progress even though high levels of liquidity, weakness in supply chains, and low-interest rates remained as headwinds.\nEconomic growth was robust in the second quarter, with real GDP estimated to have increased at an 8% annual rate with especially strong gains in consumer spending. We continued to see supply chain shortages impacting both supply and prices across many sectors. Home prices are estimated to have increased at a 24% annual rate as scarcity of properties for sale persisted and half of the unit sales exceeded the asking price. Used car prices continued to increase due to ongoing supply constraints with the second-quarter Manheim Index increasing 17% from first-quarter '21 and 45% from a year ago.\nHowever, prices may have peaked in May after four consecutive months of record highs with June's Manheim Index finishing 1.3% lower than May. For Wells Fargo consumer customers, nearly $50 billion of federal stimulus payments from rounds two and three have been deposited into our customers' accounts, and we estimate roughly 25% remained in their accounts as of July 2. For our customers who received stimulus payments, their median deposit balance was up 56% compared to April 2020, which is prior to the first round of federal stimulus payments. And for all of our customers, including customers who did not receive stimulus payments, median balances were up 49% over that same time period.\nWeekly debit card spend was up every week compared to 2019 during the second quarter. And the areas hardest hit by the pandemic have recovered, including travel, up 11%; entertainment, up 38%; and restaurant spending, up 28% during the week ending June 25 compared with 2019. Consumer credit card spending activity continued to increase, up 13% in the second quarter compared to 2019. As of the week ended June 25, travel-related spending, which was the hardest hit during the pandemic, was up significantly from 2020 but was the only category that has not fully rebounded to 2019 levels.\nOur Commercial Banking clients have also continued to have high levels of cash on hand and accommodative capital markets and supply chain disruptions to a continued decline in Commercial Banking loans outstanding, albeit at a slower pace than the last few quarters. Now that we're halfway through the year, let me update you on the progress we've made in the areas I highlighted at the beginning of the year. I've spoken at every call about our most important initiative, making progress on risk and control. Wells Fargo's top priority continues to be building the right foundation for a company of our size and complexity.\nWhen done, this should meet our regulatory requirements, and we remain committed to devoting the resources necessary to operate with strong business practices and controls, maintain the highest levels of integrity and have appropriate control and appropriate culture in place. The amount of customer remediation and control-related issues that existed when I arrived was many multiples of what should exist at our company. I've spoken of what we put in place to address these issues. And by most metrics, we are making significant progress.\nRegarding our work on consent orders and other regulatory requirements, the work remaining is significant, and as such, this remains a multi-year journey for us. While what's required for each is clear, there are numerous complexities with managing this amount of work concurrently, and it will take time to consistently accomplish all at the level we and our regulators expect. As such, we may have setbacks and progress will not be a straight line. However, I remain confident in our ability to complete the work.\nBuilding a strong management team was another key priority. When I first joined Wells, our objective was to ensure we have the talent necessary to close our risk and control gaps. During the first half of my tenure, around 60% of senior-level hires were in these functions and many more across the company directed their efforts toward these activities. This remains our most important priority today.\nWe will continue to add resources here, but we're also adding significant resources to improve our competitiveness and provide the foundation for higher levels of performance. During the second half of my tenure, while we've continued to hire senior leaders in risk and control areas, we've been increasing our hiring in areas that will grow our business with over 70% of our senior-level hires focused on this objective. This includes significant hires in data platform and analytics, strategy, digital, and our technology groups. We're focused on the cloud, payments, fintech competition, tech companies, and our own data and digital capabilities.\nHires include a digital platform leader for all of our consumer businesses, a head of digital for commercial banking and the CIB, head of strategy and innovation for consumer and small business banking, head of our commercial auto group, head of consumer banking national business development and a new head of payment strategies for the entire company. We're also adding bankers in the CIB and Commercial Bank where we see growth opportunities. We also just announced last week that we've hired Bei Ling as the new head of human resources. She will be joining us in October.\nAnd providing clear business focus and strategic direction has been important, as well as we allocate our resources. We will not do anything to jeopardize our control-related work, but we have also begun to execute on plans to build what's necessary to compete effectively in today's dynamic business environment. Our playbook was dated and it was time to provide direction and be more aggressive about building leading products, capabilities, and innovating. We've been focused on targeting our resources to what's most meaningful today for our customers by selling or closing businesses, and we're leveraging our breadth and scale to compete with banks and nonbanks alike by working to build new capabilities and work across the company to deliver all of Wells Fargo to our customer base.\nWe're rebuilding core capabilities but are beginning to instill a mobile-first mindset as part of our broader technology and data-guided efforts. One example is our credit card business where we've been working on it since I arrived to build the foundation to compete more effectively. Being competitive here is both an opportunity to grow, but more importantly, is a strategic imperative as credit and payments are critical to maintain and build customer relationships, and we'll do this with both traditional card products and other ways over time. Our playbook is simple: build an experienced management team, update and relaunch product customers will make top of wallet, improve customer service, and leverage both our branches and strong digital capabilities to serve our customers.\nIn the second quarter, we announced the first new product of several to come, an industry-leading cash back card, which is now just rolling out. We're also enhancing our deposit products. Our no overdraft product, Clear Access Banking, continued to perform well with over 825,000 accounts opened since the launch in the third quarter of last year. We also simplified and improved the benefits of our portfolio by Wells Fargo checking customers in the second quarter this year.\nThese are just a few examples of how we're moving forward, but we have initiatives across all businesses, which we'll cover over time. And lastly, we've continued to take meaningful actions and are progressing toward better returns. As we highlighted at the beginning of the year, we see a path to get to double-digit ROTCE excluding credit loss reserve releases and then moving toward approximately 15%. We said that the path to double-digit ROTCE is dependent on capital optimization and executing on our efficiency initiatives.\nWith CCAR complete and a return to the SCB framework, we're now in a position to return significant capital to shareholders. We expect to increase our third-quarter common stock dividend to $0.20 per share, subject to final board approval. Increasing our dividend is a priority, and our plan contemplates continued increases as we grow earnings capacity. Additionally, our capital plan included approximately $18 billion of gross common share repurchases starting in the third quarter and concluding in the second quarter of next year.\nThis may change depending on a variety of factors, including our earnings and economic outlook. Mike will provide more context here. Importantly, we remain on target to accomplish the expense reductions contemplated in achieving the double-digit ROTCE level. Assuming no material changes in the economic environment or interest rates, we expect to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, excluding reserve releases and other special items, both positive and negative on a run-rate basis during 2022.\nBeyond this, we continue to believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors: moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted, a modest increase in interest rates or a further steepening of the curve, ongoing progress on incremental efficiency initiatives, a small impact from returns on growth-related investments in our businesses and continued execution on our risk, regulatory and control framework. The combination of these factors, we believe, would take our ROTCE to approximately 15% over time. And while we're focused on improving our execution and results, we know that supporting our customers and communities will continue to be an important part of our mission. The work we did through the pandemic was meaningful and necessary to help those most in need, especially consumers and small businesses, but there remains much more to do.\nWe offered payment deferrals, waived fees, supported smaller and diverse small businesses through the Paycheck Protection Program. We committed to donate all gross processing fees from PPP loans funded in 2020 totaling approximately $420 million to help small businesses' recovery efforts and have completed funding of $234 million of our commitment. We expect to fund the rest by the end of the year. We are also voluntarily extending our foreclosure moratorium on mortgage loans we own through the end of this year, and we're pleased that the industry is contemplating similar foreclosure extensions.\nWe issued our first sustainability bond, which will fund projects and programs that support housing affordability, socioeconomic opportunity, and renewable energy. We partnered with diverse firms in the offering of our $1 billion sustainability bond, with approximately 75% of the economics going to these firms, underscoring our commitment to supporting historically marginalized communities. We fulfilled the pledge that we made last year to commit $50 million to Black-owned banks and communities across the country with investments in two additional African-American minority deposit institutions during the second quarter. And we announced the Banking Inclusion Initiative, a 10-year commitment to help unbanked individuals gain access to affordable transaction accounts.\nThis is a complex and long-standing issue that will require gathering the best minds, ideas, products, and educational resources from across our communities to bring about change and help remove barriers to financial inclusion. In summary, let me say that the outlook for the economy for the rest of the year is promising, assuming continued success against COVID. The restocking of inventories is expected to be substantial and the excess personal savings should provide a cushion for consumer spending. However, risks remain, interest rates have been volatile and the recent rally in rates is putting pressure on net interest income.\nWe've made meaningful progress in our important priorities during the first half of the year, but this is just the start of a multi-year process to transform Wells Fargo. I want to thank everyone at Wells for their hard work and focus on supporting our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Charlie highlighted many of the ways we're actively helping our customers and communities on Slide 2. So I'm going to start with our second-quarter financial results on Slide 3. Net income for the quarter was $6 billion or $1.38 per common share.\nAs Charlie highlighted, our second-quarter results included a $1.6 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses. Pretax, pre-provision profit grew from both a year ago and from the first quarter as we grew revenue and reduced expenses. We had $2.7 billion or approximately $2 billion after noncontrolling interests of pre-tax equity gains predominantly coming from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. Approximately $2 billion was due to unrealized gains from follow-on financing rounds, reflecting significantly higher valuations in a number of portfolio companies.\nThe remaining approximately $700 million was realized gains. Given the nature of these businesses, these gains tend to be episodic. However, since 2017, these businesses have generated annual gains in excess of $1 billion in every year except 2020, which was impacted by the pandemic. We completed the sale of student loans in the second quarter, which resulted in a $140 million gain and a $79 million write-down of related goodwill.\nOur effective income tax rate in the second quarter was 19.3%, which reflected accounting policy changes for certain tax-advantaged investments. We elected to make these changes to better align the financial statement presentation of the economic impact of these investments with the related tax credits. Prior period financial statement line items have been revised, which had a nominal impact on net income on an annual basis. The changes did improve our efficiency ratio and increased our effective income tax rate from what was previously reported.\nWe provide details regarding these changes on Slide 16 in the appendix of this deck and on Page 30 of the quarterly supplement. Reflecting on these changes, we expect our effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately 20%. Our CET1 ratio increased to 12.1% in the second quarter. This year's CCAR stress test confirmed the significant strength of our capital position.\nBased on the results, we expect our stress capital buffer to increase 60 basis points effective in the fourth quarter of this year. And as a reminder, our GSIB capital surcharge will decrease by 50 basis points effective in the first quarter of next year, which will bring our CET1 regulatory minimum to 9.1% in the first quarter of 2022. As Charlie highlighted, we plan to return a significant amount of capital to our shareholders starting in the third quarter and expect to move closer to our internal target of 100 basis points above the regulatory minimum over time. We also currently expect to maintain an incremental buffer of 25 to 50 basis points above our target to account for potential uncertainties and maintain flexibility.\nUnder the SCB framework, we will have the flexibility to increase capital distributions, and it's possible we will be able to repurchase more than the $18 billion included in our capital plan over the four-quarter period depending on market conditions and other risk factors, including COVID-related risks. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our net charge-off ratio in the second quarter declined 18 basis points. The improving economic environment with the reopening of the economy, government stimulus, and ample liquidity, as well as customer accommodations, have resulted in our credit losses continuing to trend significantly better than our expectations.\nCommercial credit performance continued to improve and loan charge-offs declined $69 million from the first quarter to seven basis points, our lowest loss rate since second quarter of 2018. The improvement was broad-based with declines in all commercial asset types, including net recoveries in commercial real estate. While the overall outlook for commercial real estate continued to improve, we remain focused on the areas most impacted by the pandemic. The reopening of the economy has continued to have a positive impact on retail and hotel as cash flow has improved.\nWhile losses and problem loans in office have been very low, we continue to monitor this sector as longer-term demand trends may be influenced by changes in hybrid work-from-home models. It's also important to note that even with the reserve release in the second quarter, our coverage ratio for commercial real estate loans was still higher than it was a year ago. Consumer net loan charge-offs declined from both the first quarter and a year ago to 32 basis points in the second quarter. Nonperforming assets declined $695 million or 8% from the first quarter driven by lower commercial nonaccruals.\nDeclines in C&I nonaccruals were driven by improvements across a number of COVID-impacted sectors, including entertainment and recreation, energy, transportation services, and retail. Declines in commercial real estate were driven by improvements in office. A year ago, $37.2 billion of our consumer loan portfolio, excluding government-insured guaranteed loans, was in COVID-related payment deferral. Deferrals have declined 79% from a year ago to $7.8 billion at the end of the second quarter.\nWe stopped offering non-real estate-related COVID deferrals in the fourth quarter of 2020 but continue to offer certain COVID-related deferrals in home lending for a maximum of 18 months. It's important to note that loans that have already exited COVID-related deferrals have continued to perform better than we anticipated, with approximately 94% of the balances current as of the end of the second quarter. We started to tighten our credit policies in March 2020 in response to the pandemic, and we have now essentially returned back to pre-COVID levels of policies. However, we continue to be thoughtful of the much higher asset prices in areas like residential real estate and auto.\nDue to the reserve release in the quarter, our allowance coverage ratio declined from both the first quarter and a year ago. Similar to the first quarter, while observed credit performance was strong, there was still significant uncertainty reflected in our allowance level at the end of the second quarter, and we'll continue to assess the level of our coverage. If current economic trends continue, we would expect to have additional reserve releases. On Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits.\nAlthough average loans declined in the quarter, the rate of decline slowed with balances down $18.7 billion or 2% from the first quarter. The decline from the first quarter was almost entirely driven by lower residential real estate loans primarily due to continued high prepayments and the resecuritization of loans we purchased out of mortgage-backed securities last year. The total period-end loans were down 1% from the first quarter. And while it's hard to predict exactly what will happen during the second half of the year and while line utilization rates remain low, we are seeing signs of green shoots with modest growth in period-end balances compared to the first quarter in auto, other consumer, credit card and commercial real estate.\nAverage deposits increased $49.1 billion or 4% from a year ago and 3% from the first quarter, with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking partially offset by continued declines in corporate and investment banking and corporate treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Now turning to net interest income on Slide 7. Net interest income was stable from the first quarter as favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, higher income due to additional forgiveness of Paycheck Protection Program or PPP loans, and one additional day in the quarter was offset by lower loan balances and the impact of lower interest rates. As we think about net interest income for the remainder of the year, the rate volatility observed over the last few weeks has shown how difficult it can be to forecast even for the next couple of quarters.\nThe key drivers continue to be demand for loans and balance sheet yields, which are impacted by the level of rates, the shape of the curve, and credit spreads. While the recent rally in rates and continued softness in loan demand have put downward pressure on net interest income, we still expect NII for the full year to remain in the range of flat to down 4% from the originally reported and annualized fourth quarter 2020 level of $36.8 billion. Where in the range we end up will be dependent on the factors I mentioned. If rates follow the current forward curve and overall loan balances remain flat from the period-end balance at the end of the second quarter for the remainder of the year, which would require modest growth in commercial loans, we would expect net interest income to be in the lower end of the range.\nIf we see rates back up from here and start to see more loan growth, we'll move up in the range. We continue to closely monitor the evolving trends across each of the major drivers of net interest income, and we'll provide updates to our outlook as the year progresses. Turning to expenses on Slide 8. Noninterest expense declined 8% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower operating losses and also reflected the progress we've made on our efficiency initiatives.\nLet me highlight a few examples. Our customers are increasingly leveraging our digital capabilities with mobile active customers up 6% from a year ago and the number of checks deposited using mobile growing 9% from a year ago. These changes and others have enabled us to adjust branch staffing, and you can see this coming through in lower headcount and expenses in the consumer banking and lending segment. Importantly, to date, we've been able to make these adjustments while improving client satisfaction.\nWe reduced the number of our locations, including branches and offices by 5% since the start of the year, a reduction of over 2 million square feet. We also recently agreed to sell our tower in downtown Phoenix, which includes over 500,000 square feet. We continue to evaluate owned locations and locations with upcoming lease expirations for closure and consolidation opportunities. We reduced professional and outside services expense by 14% during the first half of this year compared to a year ago.\nThis reduction was driven by lower spend on consultants and contractors on various projects across the company. In commercial banking, we've made progress on changing how we serve our customers, optimizing our operations and other back-office teams, and reducing the number of commercial banking lending platforms. These efforts were reflected in lower headcount expenses in the segment. We are on track in executing our efficiency plans included in our expense outlook of approximately $53 billion.\nOur outlook excluded restructuring charges and the cost of business exits, which totaled $192 million during the first half of this year and included $1 billion of operating losses, which totaled just over $500 million during the first half of the year. Keep in mind, operating losses can be lumpy and unpredictable and especially as we continue to address the significant work left to do to satisfy our regulatory requirements. We also assumed approximately $500 million of incremental revenue-related expenses, and these have been higher than expected so far this year due to strong equity markets, which is a good thing as the associated revenue more than offsets any increase in expenses. If current market levels hold, we would expect incremental revenue-related compensation to be approximately $1 billion, which could put us over $53 billion.\nWe'll continue to update you as the year progresses. Turning to our business segments starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 9. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 7% from a year ago, primarily due to higher debit card transaction volume and higher deposit-related fees, which were lower in 2020 due to fee waivers provided at the onset of the pandemic. Home lending revenue increased 40% from a year ago driven by higher servicing income as last year we had a significant negative valuation adjustment to our mortgage servicing rights asset.\nWe also had higher origination and sales revenue in the second quarter due to higher gains from the resecuritization of loans we purchased from mortgage-backed securities last year and an increase in retail originations. The 7% decline in revenue from the first quarter was primarily due to lower retail held-for-sale originations and gain-on-sale margins. Gain-on-sale margins are expected to continue to decline in the second half of the year. Credit card revenue increased 14% from a year ago driven by increased spending.\nAdditionally, in response to the pandemic, second quarter of 2020 included higher customer accommodations and fee waivers. Auto revenue increased 7% from a year ago on higher loan balances. Now turning to some key business drivers on Slide 10. While we believe mortgage originations in the industry declined from the first quarter, our mortgage originations increased 3%.\nA decline in correspondent originations was more than offset by growth in retail, with an increase in retail held-for-investment volume partially offset by lower held-for-sale volume. Our second-quarter retail mortgage origination volume increased 10% from first quarter and was the highest since 2015. We currently expect third-quarter originations to decline modestly, although refinancing volumes can be stronger than currently forecasted with the recent rate rally if lower rates persist. We also expect our retail originations to decline less than the industry as we've improved capability to serve our customers' mortgage financing needs.\nConsumer demand for auto loans continue to be very strong despite higher prices and limited inventory. Auto originations increased 19% from the first quarter and 48% from a year ago, with June setting a new monthly record for originations exceeding our previous high set in June of 2016. Turning to debit card. Purchase volume increased 12% from the first quarter and 31% from a year ago, reflecting higher consumer spending due to stimulus payments and improving economic conditions.\nCredit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 21% from the first quarter as the economy continued to open. And in May, we had our highest monthly spending volume in recent history. The increased activity has not yet translated into significantly higher balances as payment rates remain high. On Slide 11, the Commercial Banking results are highlighted.\nAnd it excludes the corporate trust business, which is now reported in corporate, and prior periods have been revised. Middle market banking revenue declined 9% from a year ago, primarily due to the impact of lower loan balances and lower interest rates, which were partially offset by higher deposit balances and deposit-related fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 12% from a year ago driven by the impact of lower loan balances, which was partially offset by improved loan spreads, higher net gains on equity securities in our strategic capital business, and higher revenue from our renewable energy investments. Noninterest expense declined 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower salaries and consulting expense.\nAverage loans declined for the fourth consecutive quarter and were down 22% from a year ago. The demand for loans declined due to low client inventory levels and strong client cash positions. While there are some green shoots in select industries, demand has not yet picked up. Average balances were up 5% from a year ago, reflecting significant liquidity from stimulus programs.\nTurning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 12. In banking, total revenue declined 6% from a year ago. The decrease was driven by lower debt capital markets revenue, the impact of lower interest rates and lower deposit balances predominantly due to actions taken to manage under the asset cap. Commercial real estate revenue grew 21% from a year ago driven by higher CMBS gain-on-sale margins and volumes.\nCommercial real estate capital markets transaction volume increased significantly from a year ago driven by low rates, tighter loan spreads, excess liquidity in the market, and stable improving real estate fundamentals. While acquisition activity picked up in the second quarter, loan demand was predominantly driven by refinance activity. Markets revenue declined 45% from a year ago from lower trading activity across most asset classes compared to the higher trading activity we experienced in the second quarter of 2020 as the markets recovered due to the monetary and fiscal stimulus in response to the pandemic. Our markets revenue has been negatively impacted by actions we've taken to manage under the asset cap as well.\nNoninterest expense declined 12% from a year ago primarily driven by lower operating losses. Average deposits declined 20% from a year ago primarily driven by continued actions we've taken to manage under the asset cap. On Slide 13, we have wealth and investment management, which grew revenue by 10% in the second quarter compared with a year ago. Noninterest income was up 18% from a year ago primarily driven by higher asset-based fees on higher market valuations, which was partially offset by lower net interest income driven by lower interest rates.\nRevenue-related compensation drove the increase in noninterest expense compared with a year ago. We ended the second quarter with record client assets of $2.1 trillion, up 20% from a year ago, reflecting strong market performance. Average deposits were up 6% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago due to customer demand for securities-based lending offerings. Slide 14 highlights our corporate results.\nRevenue growth from a year ago and from the first quarter was driven by the equity gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses that I highlighted earlier in the call. Second-quarter results also benefited from the gain on the sale of student loans and a modest gain on the sale of our Canadian equipment finance business. We will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHey. Good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nCan you hear me OK?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nAll right. Thanks. Hey. So I did just want to understand a little bit about the commentary that you were making earlier around the 10% ROTCE that you're expecting you will be able to do that in 2022 without reserve release, which is seemingly a pretty bold statement given what consensus is looking for.\nIf I ex out the reserve release, it feels like there's a percentage point or so differential there. Can you help us understand what the drivers are going to be to do that? And if it's in the expenses, can you give us some sense as to which parts of your business is going to be feeding that 10% most?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So let me start out and then Mike can chime in. I guess the way we thought about it is to just, let's first start and think about the earnings of this quarter and do our best to look through all of those things which we know aren't really recurring. And so if you think about the sale of the student loan business, the change in allowance, and even obviously, we've got those outsized gains in NEP, NVP.\nBut at the same time, we don't assume they go to 0 over the course of the following year. And then you could even normalize for charge-offs, getting them to somewhat of a higher level. But if you do that, what we've said is that with our expense reductions that we've contemplated with the ability to return capital, you can get to that level. And so we've obviously had the ability now to return a significant amount of excess capital that we have.\nThat's an extremely meaningful driver of the improvement in ROTCE. And think about it as like a somewhat modest improvement in the rest of the performance to get there in terms of the company from where we sit today. So we don't want to talk in any level of specificity at this point about the specifics about expenses, but we're working extremely hard not just to get the efficiencies that were important to meet our expectations for this year, but to position us properly next year to reduce expenses on a net basis while we have the ability to invest significantly inside the company.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And I would just point out, Betsy, it's not a full-year 2022. What he said was, it's the run rate in 2022 at some point. Right?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nRight. So it could be your 4Q exit run rate.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nCould be.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. And then just separately, could you speak to the flexibility on the buybacks? I know you indicated the $18 billion or $18.5 billion under the SCB framework. Should we be taking that as a minimum buyback level because I think that reflects your ask in the or at least what you -- not an ask, but what you put into the test. And you've got earnings that you're generating and the environment is improving.\nSo could you imagine that buybacks could be higher than that over the course of the next four quarters?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I mean, I think the signal is that it could be higher or lower depending on exactly how our results turn out and what we think the outlook for the economy is and potentially where the stock price is, even though that's really not a factor in our thinking today given our view of the valuation. We obviously would hope that it would be more, not less. And we have the flexibility under the SCB framework to do that.\nSo I think you all can do your calculations on what you think we'll earn next year. We've given you the guidelines for how we're thinking about where we're targeting our capital ratios to be. And we don't see any need to have excess capital sitting around the company at this point, especially given the fact that we have the asset cap.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. Charlie, Mike, thanks so much. Appreciate it.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHey. Good afternoon. So I wanted to start off with a question just on the headcount trajectory. You started to make some real progress driving some of the headcount reductions that you've spoken to.\nIt's down about 6% year on year. But if I comp you against the peer group, BofA probably being the closest comp, you still have 50,000 more employees despite a similar business mix and scale. I recognize that certainly some of that's going to be tied to the consent order. I was hoping, Charlie, you can maybe just give us some context or perspective on, as you start to execute on the plan of optimizing that headcount, what's the right level to support your strategic vision for the franchise?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I think it's a great question. I think your numbers are accurate, for sure. Just a couple of things I'd say.\nI think, first of all, you can imagine, we try and do all those numbers ourselves. And between other places that we've all worked at the senior management team, it is very hard to get apples-to-apples because different people in-source different functions. But directionally, your point is still right. So I'm not sure if the magnitude is exactly right versus just Bank of America, but directionally, I think it is a fair statement.\nAnd I think that is a simple driver that gets everyone's attention here as well as, frankly, just as we look around the company and we see our processes and we see the things that we haven't done nearly as well. And so that's why when we think about the future that we have, we still continue to believe that there are significant efficiencies on a gross basis that we'll be able to continue to drive out the company. Over time, we would love to do as much of it through natural attrition as possible. Given the size of the company, we have significant attrition and people self-select because of how we're going about doing things.\nBut I think when we think about where we're going and our ability to reinvest in the company, we think that there's a lot there. And I think, again, as we get toward the end of the year, we'll talk about next year with some more specificity and at some point give you a little more clarity. I think we're still in the stage of peeling the onion back. And every time you peel a layer of the onion back, you see the next layer even more clearly, and I think we're still in that stage.\nBut it does give us a pretty good feeling about our ability to continue to drive this forward.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThanks for that perspective, Charlie. And just for my follow-up on the NII outlook, Mike, I was hoping you could just unpack the NII guidance a bit further. Specifically, what does it contemplate in terms of premium and excess liquidity deployment? And is there any noise relating to some of the loan sales that could drive some volatility in the back half as we think about the trajectory?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. There's no noise from loan sales per se, but let me break out aspects of it and kind of talk through what was included there. So obviously, the curve is going to be an important element of it. And what we said in the remarks, right, is that at this point, we're assuming it's about where it is.\nRight? It's been bouncing around the last few days, but sort of think about it as about where it is right now. And then as you sort of look forward on loans and you assume that overall loans stay sort of flattish to where we exited the quarter, that does require a little bit of growth, modest growth on the commercial side. And so that's sort of embedded in the assumption. I think on premium amort, you saw it come down a bit in the quarter versus the first quarter.\nWe're still expecting that to come down. I think it could bounce around slightly versus what the assumptions are given where rates are, but we think the direction is still the right direction. And then you may have a little bit of noise between Q3 and Q4 given some of the PPP-related forgiveness that may happen. So that's sort of what we're assuming overall.\nAnd that gets you toward the bottom of the range that we've given. Hopefully, we're surprised by loan growth or a back up in rates again, but that's what we're assuming at this point.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThat's great color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThanks. Hey, Mike. On the mortgage business, I wanted to ask you, you said that you had the loans that were in the loan book that you moved into and resecuritized. Just can you help us understand how much of a benefit that might have been in mortgage banking this quarter and just your general outlook for origination trends and what's happening in the gain-on-sale market? Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Good questions, Ken. So I'll try and pick it. If I miss something, let me know.\nBut as you sort of think about gain on sale, the gain on sale continues to come down each quarter, and we would expect that to continue. And at this point, what that's driven by is just the capacity that's been built up in the industry. And as people get a little more competitive on price, that's going to drive gain on sale down. Now I think what you've also seen us do there is really focus on the retail channel and to some degree de-emphasize the correspondent channel or use it to kind of fill in the capacity that we've got.\nAnd so that should be helpful as we sort of think about gain on sale, but the direction is certainly going down. And I think, as I said, at this point, I think it's really capacity-driven more than anything else from here forward. As you look at the -- and I also said in the remarks that we think origination volumes were going to be down a bit in Q3 versus Q2. Now there's lots of different prognostications on the market.\nWe think based on what we're seeing, we think we'll be down less than the market, but nonetheless, we'll be a little bit down. Now if we could see a little bit of a gap of refi activity that could change that a little bit. But right now, we think it's probably down just a little. As you look at the impact of the EPBO gains, it was about $150 million increase on a linked-quarter basis.\nWe do expect to continue to have some gains in the third and fourth quarter. It probably comes down a bit from where it was in the second quarter as we sort of look quarter by quarter, but maybe a little bit less than what it increased versus the first quarter, but we do expect those to continue. And you'll see, we still got about a little under $20 billion of those loans on the balance sheet, and you'll see the exact number when we put out the Q.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nAll right. Great. Thanks. And just one follow-up on the consumer-related fees.\nIt's good to see the deposit-related side and card rebounding. Can you just talk about the type of momentum that you're seeing there? And just should we expect ongoing improvements from here in those areas?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look. It's just activity levels picking up, and you can see that in the card volume metrics that we put out there. And so I think assuming we continue to see the recovery take hold and activity levels pick up and those are highly correlated there so.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd this is Charlie. I would just add, I would say slightly different dynamics on debit and credit. Right? Debit, if you look at the remarks that I made, consumers still have a substantial amount of cash. You see it in overall deposit levels, and the willingness to spend as things open up is certainly what you're seeing.\nAnd so that should continue to drive debit spend upward. And then credit is having similar benefits from reopening that the whole industry is seeing.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thanks, guys.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. Want to see if you can give a little bit more color just around the loan growth outlook. Maybe if you could talk about commercial versus consumer on the commercial side. Are you starting to see utilization trends turn? And is CAPEX beginning to contribute to some increased willingness to draw down? And then on the consumer side, just curious what you're seeing in terms of payment rates, specifically in the card businesses.\nAre we starting to see the payment rates inflect? And do you think that's sustainable?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Hey, John. It's Mike. I'll take that and Charlie can jump in if he wants.\nI'll try to pick it apart piece by piece. In the commercial bank, loans are still down and utilization rates are pretty low on a historic basis. And I think, overall, that has not inflected yet. And there's lots of reasons, high liquidity, supply chain issues, demand for product in certain industries, lots of things that sort of underpin that, but we haven't really seen that inflect yet.\nThere's a little bit of maybe differences by size of clients or by sector, but overall, it's still not quite there yet. Now there's lots of good conversations. So I think people are really thinking about investments and really are thinking about building inventory levels over the coming quarters. But I think that will take some time before it starts to translate into loan growth in the commercial bank.\nIn the corporate and investment bank, we do see a little. Loans there are up a little bit. So you're seeing some activity in subscription finance, real estate, in a few places. But again, relatively small so far, but you are seeing a little bit of activity there, and we'll see how that progresses.\nOn the consumer side, I know a lot of others are talking about this too. If you look at sort of the end-of-period balances, you're seeing a little bit of growth in auto. We had a really good quarter from an origination point of view in the auto business, but it's a relatively small portfolio in the scheme of the balance sheet. You're seeing a little bit of growth in card.\nAlthough the activity has really picked up there, it hasn't quite translated into bigger volumes given the payment rates, as you sort of pointed out. Payment rates are still really high, and I think they'll come down and normalize eventually, but they're still pretty high. So I think we'll see how that progresses. And then we still expect a further decline, albeit at a much slower pace in the home lending space as we work out of the EPBO, the early buyout loans and see prepayment activity start to stabilize in that business.\nSo we'll see how it all comes together over the next quarter or two.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK, Mike. That's helpful. And then separately, on the consumer front, can you maybe elaborate a little bit on the rationale for exiting the personal credit lines as a product? And if there's any other areas like that within your lending product suite that you might be considering similarly to exit? Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. This is Charlie. That was a product of a pretty exhaustive effort that we went through across the whole company to look at what we thought was core, where we had some kind of strategic advantage, or where it really was important for the customer relationships as we look forward. And so out of that exercise came our decisions to sell Corporate Trust, to exit the international wealth business, sell the asset management businesses, and a couple of other things that we've announced.\nThe things that we've announced are the things that we're actively working on. And so there's nothing more in progress now. The way we looked at the business was, quite simply, it was a very, very small business for us. We have products in our card products, as well as we were still in the personal loan business.\nAnd so we have the ability to continue to serve customers who either want access to credit or actual being able to draw down and fund it over term. And so again, the idea of just simplifying the company around focusing on products that are most important to the broadest set of customers, that's what led us to the decision.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. All right. Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, gentlemen. Mike, can you share with us, I don't think you've addressed this, but your loan loss reserves remain very strong. You guys have very strong credit as evidenced by this quarter in the history of this company.\nAnd your reserves are about 100 basis points, I think, above where they were at day one in January of 2020 when you guys did the CECL true-up. Can you share with us the outlook for reserves? Could they get back down to that level? And if the outlook is even better than it was in January of 2020, could the reserves actually fall below the CECL levels?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look, Gerard. I think that's, first, on the reserves, we need to be reserved for a whole bunch of different scenarios on any given time. And so as we sort of look at the path that we're on, there's a lot to be optimistic about, but there are still some risks there that we need to be mindful of from where we are today.\nBut if things keep progressing, we should have future releases, as we have noted. As you think about where you end up, I think that's a hard thing to call right now in terms of any degree of certainty at a point in time because it will be a function of, as you mentioned, the outlook that you have at that point, the mix of your balance sheet and other factors that go into sort of your view on the future and what could happen. But could we end up a little bit higher? Maybe. Could we end up a little bit lower? Maybe.\nI think they're all possible scenarios depending on what point in time you're talking about. And as you know, there's a lot of things like elements of the office market and commercial real estate that will take a while to really play out. And so we'll see how that progresses over time, but I think it will be a function of all those things of exactly where we end up.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. And I know this question is putting the cart before the horse, and I'm not asking you guys to predict when the asset cap will be lifted. But when the asset cap is lifted, how do you think you'll proceed going forward? There's been some talk in the markets that some of your peer banks are being stretched with their supplementary leverage ratio. In fact, JPMorgan now has told us that this is their binding constraint.\nAnd you have to wonder if the wholesale deposit market is going to be disrupted because of this. Freeing up Wells Fargo without the asset cap may give you guys the opportunity to pick up some wholesale deposits. So again, not asking when the asset cap is going to be lifted, but how does it look after it is lifted? What are you guys thinking?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, again, I think it's very hard to answer the question because, as you know, we don't know the timing of the asset cap, just as we don't know the timing of any changes, which could potentially happen on SLR or the way other banks will deal with that. So there are a whole series of unknowns that go into the question that I'm not sure that we're in a position to answer just quite frankly.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And I would just add two things. If you think about the actions, and we've been very public about this. A lot of the actions we've taken as a result of the asset cap is to work with clients to manage deposits through other vehicles or other institutions in some cases.\nAnd we continue to do that. So there's likely to be opportunity there with clients. And we've managed areas like our markets business down, and I think a lot of that is financing-type trades. And some of that, we think there'll be demand at the right time.\nAnd so I think as you sort of look at that, there should be plenty of opportunity for us as we look forward. But as Charlie said, exactly what shape that will take is a little bit of a function of when it happens.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Appreciate the color.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nHi, guys. Some of this has been kind of weaved throughout the call, but I was hoping you could just put together. If we look at the next two or three years and obviously assuming you're well past the asset cap, what are some of the key organic revenue growth drivers for Wells Fargo and how meaningful can they be? You mentioned credit card. You just mentioned some of the markets and wholesale business as a wildcard.\nBut maybe kind of list like three or four of them, if there are, and what might move the needle as we think about the next few years? Because you're probably one of the few stories where, yes, you've got leverage to rising rates, but there's also an organic cost opportunity like you talked about and probably some organic revenue opportunity, too. So hoping to just kind of package that together for us.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. No. I appreciate the question. And again, so I'll just put aside the interest rate environment for a second.\nAnd I think, listen, the reality is, I'm not sure what the right period of time is. But I'll just say, for a period of time, we have been laggards across most of our businesses at growing revenues. For many, many years, we had very, very strong financial performance. It's been a while since that's been the case.\nAnd when you look at the underlying trends of the businesses, while I personally think we've done remarkably well in terms of our share stats across the franchise given all that this company has been through, which says an awful lot about the people on the front lines that do it day in and day out, there's just been very little that we've really done to focus on growing the franchise. And I do want to be fair to everyone here, right, which is that given all the issues that we've had, whether it's sales practices in the consumer bank as an example. Mary Mack's job when she was put into that role was to fix that problem, not to focus on growing the business. And we continue to have other issues around the company.\nSo as we've talked about where our priorities are, as I said in my remarks, we understand that continuing to build the risk and control infrastructure and satisfy the regulatory requirements is a gate to a really successful future of ours that we need to get through. But at the same time, just answering your question, I really do believe the opportunities exist in every one of our core businesses. And when we go through and we think about the consumer segment, again, we've been getting a reasonable share of deposit flow, not because we're pricing for it, not because we've done anything really interesting in our coverage model, our products, our digital or anything like that. It's because of who we are and the relationships that we have.\nWe need to alter the course by changing all the things that I just mentioned. And those are the things that we're actively working in the background, whether it's all of our digital capabilities with this mobile-first attitude, looking at all of our products and services, thinking about how we serve the different segments, using the data and information that we have to become more targeted in our offerings. That should drive a different level of growth in the consumer business. We've talked about the card businesses as one of the pieces of our consumer lending business.\nYou pick a business, in our middle market business, we don't see much revenue growth, both because of rates and because of balances there. We do believe we're the best commercial lender in the country and the best at being in a position to serve those customers far more broadly. And so whether it's through improving our treasury management products or the work that we've talked about utilizing our CIB platform to sell investment bank products to these customers who we bank for decades is just a very meaningful opportunity for us. The CIB, we're not going to be all things to all people.\nWhen you look at our fees relative to the lending commitments that we have out there just as a measure of opportunity, we're not even close to where a company with our existing risk profile should be. And by the way, the team has been improving it, but we're not shy to say we want to improve it even more from here, focused by industry, focused by product, utilizing the competitive advantages that we have. So I really believe, and I don't want to leave anyone out, win the exact same thing. We've got online capabilities in WellsTrade that we've completely underutilized.\nWe have a platform for brokers that want to go independent that we've completely underutilized. And there, too, all the things that Barry Sommers is doing to bring our platforms together to be able to offer all of the best products across all the platforms, do a better job with things like security-based loans and mortgages where our stats clearly lag the competition. Those are just some sound bites, but we really believe it's everywhere. And so that work is going on in the background.\nAnd hopefully, what you'll start to see, like you've seen with credit card, is you'll start to see things come to market. But again, nothing is going to jeopardize the risk work we have to do.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nSo it obviously sounds very broad-based in terms of the opportunity, but any way to size it, either if you didn't have the asset cap, your balance sheet would be, say, $200 billion bigger now? Or if loan growth for the industry is 4% over the next several years per year, you can do 50% better than that. Just any sound bites on sizing where you could be now if you didn't have it or where you, again, this is longer term.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMatt, honestly, we're not even thinking about what life is like without the asset cap. We quantify for ourselves what the impact is on having it in this environment because that's the reality of it, but there are plenty of opportunities. I mean, if you go through all the things that I spoke about before, very few of those require balance sheet. Now it doesn't mean that there's no opportunity cost for having it, but that's not an excuse for us not to do some other things.\nAnd when we get to the future, we'll talk about it when we get there.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And, Matt, I've quantified some of the actions we've taken in the past in other forums. And so I'd go back to some of that. But it's significant.\nIt's hundreds of billions of dollars of actions we've taken to help manage through the asset cap. So that should give you a pretty good sense of what the impact has been.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with J.P. Morgan.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions, Charlie and Mike. A quick clarification to your answer to just the last question. Charlie, you said you aren't contemplating life without the asset cap.\nDoes that mean that the $18 billion buyback that you're talking about in the CCAR, that assumes the current situation? It does not assume the lift of the asset cap?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Vivek, what I think he meant was, we're not playing a bunch of what-ifs like where we would have been right now if the asset cap wasn't in place. Right? So I think that's, I would take that in that context. And I think as we sort of look for our capital planning, we're assuming that it's in place during the period.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. Second quick one for you, Mike. Hedge ineffectiveness gain, how much was it, and could it continue?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. The hedge ineffectiveness absolute impact in the quarter is very small. You do have a bit of a linked-quarter variance because we had a negative hedge ineffectiveness result in the first quarter given what happened with rates during the first quarter, but the absolute impact that's embedded in the second quarter is actually really small, Vivek.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. So then something else drove down that long-term debt cost by 50 basis points?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Yes. I think if you look at long-term debt, right, part of it is we reduced our long-term debt. You look at the absolute long-term debt costs, we reduced the amount and the rates down.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. Great. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of David Long with Raymond James.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nHi, everyone. As it relates to the buybacks, it seems like you guys are pretty optimistic on your capital levels and the economic backdrop. Can you accelerate the pace of buybacks here in the near term? By that, I mean, is it possible that you could buy back a higher fraction in the third quarter, meaning $5 billion or $6 billion worth of your stock?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look. We're always looking at the pace, and we're not going to get into specifics of what we're going to do before.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd when you say fast, we haven't said how much we intend to do by quarter.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And so obviously, we're going to be mindful of the pacing that we do it, and we're going to be prudent about that. And we start with a lot of extra capital. So we feel really confident that we'll be able to get that moving at the right pace soon.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks for that color. And then my second question relates to the PPP forgiveness. And it's not going to be huge to the bottom line for you guys, but could you disclose what the impact was on forgiveness fees in the quarter specific to the second quarter?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWe did not. We did see our PPP balances come down from roughly about $12 billion to about $8 billion so. And we'll see those continue to come down. And we'll continue to have some impact as the remaining loans start to get forgiven over the next few quarters.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd also keep in mind that we had said that we are giving away the fees. And so very little, if any, net bottom-line impact from that.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So we're giving away the fees for, the gross fees for the loans that originated in 2020. And that's mostly what's being forgiven now.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGot it. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question will come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHi. I just had a very quick follow-up. And I know this is a few years out, Charlie, but I think you mentioned, over time, you think the bank can achieve a 15% ROTCE. How much of that is dependent on interest rates moving higher? And does that eventually need the asset cap to move higher for Wells to get to that 15% kind of ROTCE?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Yes. It certainly does assume that the asset cap is gone, and it assumes higher rates, and we haven't really been specific about exactly what that means. And what we've said is, listen, we first want to get to double digits.\nWe're on a journey, and that's where we're headed. And once we get to 10%, then we can talk with some more clarity about what's next.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. And just in terms of clarifying your guidance on expenses. As we think about beyond 2022, is it safe to assume that incremental expense growth would be driven by revenue generation as opposed to further investments? So there may be some room in terms of cost expense savings beyond this year?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. We haven't talked about our outlook on expenses past this year. I think what we've said, which I think is continuing to be true, is that we're in the middle of a multi-year efficiency program. And even with some of the investments that we need to make that we should be able to bring expenses down on a net basis for the next couple of years.\nSo I think that still stands.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour final question will come from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHey, Mike. Wanted to just do another quick follow-up on the expense comments for this year. Could you just repeat what you said about the revenue-related expenses and where they're trending relative to what you baked in and kind of how that ties to the $53 billion target for this year?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. No. Sure. Sure, John.\nThanks. Embedded in our original outlook of about $53 billion, we assume that revenue related would increase about $500 million. And at this point, we think that's probably more like $1 billion, so an incremental $500 million. And that's really largely driven by the advisory assets and business that we have in our wealth management group that's doing really well, particularly given where the market levels have been.\nAnd so that's putting pressure on the $53 billion. So it's possible if that holds that we could be a little over $53 billion. And obviously, that excludes restructuring and the cost of business exits. So that's the way to think about it.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. It also includes the expense benefit of business exits, too. Right? So that's not factored into that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo. No. The $53 billion, yes. Sorry.\nThe $53 billion, John, assumes that those businesses were here the full year except for the student loan business. But for corporate trust and asset management, assume they were there the full year. Once we get to closing, which should happen later this year, we'll update how we think that's going to progress based on how we think the transition service agreements will play out.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And then just looking at your year-to-date expense numbers, the cadence then implies that you're stepping down in the back half of the year to something that kind of averages closer to $13 billion a quarter. I'm just kind of playing out the math. Is that the right way to think about it?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I think that's what the math would imply.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John.\nOperator\nAnd with that, I'll turn the conference back over to management.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGreat. Well, listen, thank you all so much for the time. We appreciate it. And if we don't talk to you during the quarter, we'll talk to you next quarter.\nTake care.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 70 minutes\nCall participants:\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nVivek Juneja -- J.P.

Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie. \nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our first-quarter results, the operating environment, and update you on a few important topics. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review the first-quarter results in more detail. We earned $4.7 billion or $1.05 per common share in the first quarter.\nAs you can see, these results included a $1.6 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses. Higher net interest income more than offset a decline in net interest income, and expenses are just beginning to reflect progress on our efficiency work. The impact of this work should increase in the latter half of the year. Credit quality continued to outperform our expectations with charge-offs at historical lows, but low interest rates and tepid loan demand remained headwinds for us during the quarter.\nAnd we continue to manage within the constraints of our asset cap, which require us to anticipate the inflows from government stimulus, effects of QE, and additional fiscal actions which could impact our balance sheet. Overall economic trends improved during the quarter, and while there are risks, the likelihood of improvement continues to increase, and you certainly see this in the markets. Equity markets are rising. Spreads have tightened, and liquidity is strong.\nAdditional fiscal stimulus, continued monetary support, and the acceleration of vaccine availability provide a path to a more complete reopening and further economic expansion. U.S. GDP growth is on track to surpass its pre-pandemic peak by the end of the summer and is expected to increase in 2021 by more than any year since 1984. Overall, the consumer is strong, though there are inconsistencies, which I will address later.\nConsumer net worth was up 10% in 2020, hitting a new all-time high of $130 trillion. Personal savings is approximately $1.3 trillion greater today than it was a year ago. It's expected that more than $1 trillion will be spent over the next five months. And this does not include the impact of President Biden's proposed initiatives, Wells Fargo customers, excuse me, specifically.\nAs of last week, over $46 billion has flowed into our customers' deposit accounts related to round 2 and round 3 of federal stimulus payments, and we estimate that half has been spent and half remains in their accounts. For our customers who received federal stimulus payments, their median deposit balance was up 80% from a year ago. And for all of our customers, including customers who did not receive stimulus payments, median balances were up 62% from a year ago. Weekly debit card spend was up every week compared to a year ago during the first quarter.\nThe year-over-year increase accelerated in March -- in mid-March due to the impact of last year's COVID-related restrictions and the impact of stimulus payments and was up approximately 70% during this week last year of the quarter compared to a year ago but was up 35% compared to the same week in 2019. We are seeing increased consumer spending activity in both travel and restaurants, two categories that have been particularly suppressed since the onset of COVID-19. Specifically for travel, for the week ended April 2nd, debit card spend was up 422% compared to 2020 but was still down 4% compared to 2019. Consumer credit card weekly spend continues to strengthen over the course of the first quarter as well and ended up \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and ended the quarter up approximately 70% during the last week of the quarter compared to a year ago but, importantly, up 8% compared to the same week in 2019.\nBusinesses remain strong as well. Most clients still have strong cash positions, and line utilization remain low. Demand for consumer products is high, and dealer inventory levels are meaningfully lower versus historical levels. After declining during the second half of the year, commercial loan balances seem to have stabilized.\nAnd if the economy continues to pick up, we would expect to see increased loan demand from our commercial customers in the second half of the year. With vaccine distribution accelerating, I'm hopeful that we will be shifting to a more normal way of life soon, but there's still many that will continue to need help as not all have benefited equally during the recovery. Throughout the pandemic, our focus has been providing support for our customers and the communities we serve, and we continued those efforts during the first quarter. Since the pandemic began, we've helped 3.7 million consumer and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees.\nIn addition to our $10.5 billion of PPP funding in 2020, in the first quarter, we funded approximately 70,000 loans totaling $2.8 billion under the latest round of the Paycheck Protection Program. This year, we focused even more on small and diverse businesses, and our average loan size was $40,000, down from $54,000 last year. We had the lowest average loan size among our large-bank peers. 96% have been for businesses with fewer than 20 employees.\n43% have gone to businesses in either low- to moderate-income areas, where majority -- minority census tracts totaling more than $6 billion between this year and last year. We committed last year to donate approximately $420 million of our fees from the PPP program and established our Open for Business Fund. We're in the process of distributing these funds to a combination of CDFIs and not-for-profits that serve diverse small businesses. To date, we have distributed over $125 million and are working to accelerate distribution of the remaining funds.\nWe estimate that these actions have protected more than 66,000 jobs and hope to make an even more substantial impact with the funds remaining. As we announced yesterday, we have invested in 11 Black minority-owned deposit institutions as part of our $50 million commitment to support MDIs. We expect to complete our investments in another two by the end of the second quarter. And as I mentioned before, we processed over $46 billion of customer deposits related to the federal stimulus payments through last week and of cash stimulus payments for noncustomers without charging fees.\nWhile we're proud of these actions, we know there is still more to do. Lower-income families and individuals, as well as minority-owned small businesses, will continue to need support, and we will continue to look for ways to help. Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time. And last month, Wells Fargo announced a major step in our efforts to support the transition to a low-carbon economy by setting a goal of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, including financed emissions, by 2050.\nWe committed to publish data on our financed emissions and set interim goals as we work closely with our clients in this transition. We also released our first task force for climate-related disclosure \u00e2\u0080\u0093 or I'm sorry, Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures report in the first quarter, which provides an update on our progress managing climate-related risks and opportunities. Let me turn to make some comments about our strategic priorities. Last quarter, in my shareholder letter, I discussed the -- in the shareholder letter, I discussed the actions we're taking to improve our performance, and we're making good progress.\nWe continue to prioritize the work necessary to build the appropriate risk and control infrastructure, and it remains our top priority. As a reminder, this is a multi-year journey. Progress may not be a straight line, and while we still have significant work to do, we are diligently doing what's necessary, issue by issue. It's hard to share specifics given the nature of the work, but I believe we're making progress, and we're confident in our ability to complete the work.\nIn terms of business exits, I highlighted on the call last quarter that we were focusing our efforts on our core scaled businesses. And after rigorous reviews, we were in the process of exploring options for businesses that were not consistent with our strategic priorities. Mike will cover the financial details. But in the first quarter, we announced agreements to sell Wells Fargo Asset Management and the Corporate Trust Services businesses, and both are expected to close in the second half of this year.\nIn addition, we completed a portion of the sale of the student loan portfolio, and we completed the sale of the majority of the remaining portfolio recently. We're pleased that we have found buyers who, we believe, have a similar approach to service and are focused on providing clients with innovative products and solutions. These announcements are an important step to simplifying our business and allowing us to focus on our core strategic priorities. Our work to simplify how we operate and create a more efficient organization continues.\nWe made progress on our brand staffing and network optimization plans as we calibrate for changing customer behaviors and more traffic migrates to digital channels. We continue to execute on our commercial banking transformation as we optimize our coverage and operations model, consolidate lending platforms, and automate and standardize many manual processes such as onboarding, a customer pain point which has been key for us. And across the entire enterprise, we continue our ongoing efforts to reduce management layers to speed decision-making and reduce unnecessary bureaucracy. We are also focused on moving our businesses forward.\nA few examples. On the consumer banking side, we're accelerating our investments in digital with a particular focus on delivering a simple, easy-to-use, best-in-class customer experience for the most-used mobile app features. We're also simplifying and enhancing our product line, including launching Clear Access Banking, our low-cost, no-overdraft product, and we've opened over 500,000 new accounts since the launch last fall. And this summer, we will be improving the benefits of our portfolio by Wells Fargo checking customers.\nAs I've spoken about before, we're underpenetrated in credit card given our customer footprint, and we're working on developing a significantly improved value proposition that we can introduce to the market. And on the commercial side, we're going after the middle-market investment banking opportunity in a different way than we have previously. This includes joint accountability, investments in talent, name-by-name client prioritization, and joint account planning. Mike will discuss capital more in his remarks, but our position remains extremely strong.\nWe repurchased almost $600 million of common stock in the quarter. And based on the restrictions still in place for the second quarter, we have the capacity to return approximately $1.8 billion to shareholders. As a reminder, our asset cap limits our ability to deploy excess capital to our customers. Returning capital to shareholders remains a priority, and we look forward to resuming capital returns under the stress capital buffer methodology starting in the third quarter.\nLast quarter, I discussed constraints to achieving return on tangible common equity greater than 10% and then around 15%. I should note that those returns did not include credit loss reserve releases. The asset cap and capital return restrictions continue, but the progress on vaccination distribution, ongoing monetary policy, additional fiscal stimulus, and higher interest rates are helpful. We're in the midst of a multi-year transformation, and I'm confident that our operational and financial performance will continue to benefit from the progress we're making.\nI'd like to end by acknowledging that we've asked so much of our entire Wells Fargo team, and I'm proud of all the work they've done to support our customers and the communities we serve. We will continue to do all we can to support an equitable recovery and help those most in need of our support. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Charlie highlighted many of the ways we're actively helping our customers and communities, which we highlighted on Slide 2, so I'm going to start with our first-quarter financial results on Slide 3. Net income for the quarter was $4.7 billion or $1.05 per common share. Revenue grew from both a year ago and the fourth quarter as the decline in net interest income was more than offset by higher noninterest income.\nOur first-quarter results included a $1.6 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses. And as a reminder, in the first half of last year, we built reserves by a total of $11.5 billion, and we had $18 billion of allowance for credit losses at the end of the first quarter. We completed the sale of approximately half of our student loan portfolio in the first quarter, which resulted in a $208 million gain and $104 million goodwill writedown, and we closed the majority of the remaining portfolio just this past weekend. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was 6.4%, which included net discrete income tax benefits related to closing out prior year's tax matters.\nOur capital and liquidity remained strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.8% under the standardized approach and 12.6% under the advanced approach. We repurchased 17.2 million shares of common stock for a total of $506 million -- $596 million and we had $33 billion of excess capital over our CET1 regulatory minimum at quarter-end. Our liquidity coverage ratio was 127%.\nTurning to Slide 5 which summarizes the financial impact of the business sales Charlie highlighted, we had included -- we have included the 2020 revenue and expense associated with the businesses in the slide. While they represented a little over 3% of 2020 revenue, the pre-tax earnings is much smaller. Note that the table does not include the credit costs associated with the student loan portfolio, which can have a meaningful impact on the business's P&L, and the expected expense reductions related to this business are incorporated into our $53 billion outlook for the year. Also, the expenses we have included related to the corporate trusts and asset management businesses are the total expenses for those businesses.\nSome of those expenses may continue after we close the deals as we have transition service agreements, and roughly 10% to 20% of those expenses are items such as corporate overhead that will take time to manage out of the expense run rate. In terms of segment reporting, the asset management business is now reported in corporate. Given that we announced the sale of the corporate trust business late in the quarter, that business is still included in commercial banking and will move to the corporate sector in the second quarter. Turning to credit quality on Slide 6.\nOur net charge-off ratio in the first quarter declined to 24 basis points, the lowest it's been in a number of years and down 14 basis points from a year ago. Our losses have trended significantly better than our expectations due to the impact of forbearance programs and the unprecedented amounts of government stimulus. While there's still a lot of uncertainty, there are encouraging and improving trends related to commercial credit quality. Commercial net loan charge-offs declined $159 million from the fourth quarter to 13 basis points, the lowest loss rate since the third quarter of 2019.\nThe improvement was broad-based with declines in all asset types including $116 million of lower commercial real estate losses. As we have done since the start of the pandemic, we continue to closely monitor our exposure to retail, hotel, and office property types. The reopening in economy has had a positive impact on retail and hotel as cash flow levels have begun to improve. That said, stress remains and retail -- and retail, in particular, was the driver of charge-offs in the first quarter.\nThough clearly, there are negative demand trends in many office markets, the office portfolio continues to perform well and we're not seeing any widespread stress in the portfolio as of now. Consumer net charge-offs declined $221 million from a year ago with improvements across all asset types, but increased $88 million for the fourth quarter with higher losses in other consumer loans and credit card but still can -- but still continue to be low. Non-performing assets declined $692 million or 8% from the fourth quarter, driven by lower commercial nonaccruals primarily due to declines in energy and commercial real estate nonaccruals. $10.7 billion of our consumer loan portfolio, excluding government-insured loans remain in COVID-related payment deferrals at the end of the first quarter.\nWe stopped offering non-real estate-related COVID deferrals in the fourth quarter, and 98% of the balances that were still in deferral at quarter-end were real estate-related. Loans that have already exited COVID deferrals have continued to perform better than we anticipated with over 95% of the balances current as of the end of the first quarter. Though we're not -- though we're still not all the way back to pre-pandemic levels, we've continued to adjust our credit policies to reflect better economic conditions. Due to the reserve release in the first quarter, our allowance coverage ratio declined from the fourth quarter but was up 90 basis points from a year ago.\nSimilar to the fourth quarter, while observed performance has been strong, there was still a significant amount of uncertainty reflected in our allowance level at the end of the first quarter and we'll continue to assess the level of our allowance. If the economic trends continue, we would expect to have additional reserve releases. On Slide 8, we highlight loans and deposits. Our average loans declined for the third consecutive quarter and were down 9% from a year ago.\nThe decline from the fourth quarter was driven by lower residential real estate loans due to continued high prepayments and resecuritization of loans we purchased out of mortgage-backed securities last year. Real estate loan balances have been impacted by actions we took early last year to discontinue correspondent, non-conforming originations, and home equity lending. We have started to originate correspondent, non-conforming loans again and should start to see more volume from this channel over time. Commercial loans were relatively stable from the fourth quarter but were down 8% from a year ago when there was a strong borrower draw activity during the early stages of the pandemic.\nAverage deposits grew $55.5 billion or 4% from a year ago and 1% from the fourth quarter with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking, partially offset by declines in the corporate investment and banking business, corporate treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. With continued deposit growth, we have been actively managing down our long-term debt outstanding. We tendered for $6.8 billion of senior and subordinated debt in the first quarter. And along with maturities, total long-term debt declined $29.6 billion or 14% from the fourth -- fourth quarter and was down 23% from a year ago.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 9. Net interest income declined 5% from the fourth quarter, driven by two fewer days, unfavorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results, continued repricing of the balance sheet, and lower loan balances. These impacts were partially offset by the benefit of lower long-term debt. On the call last quarter, we provided our 2021 net interest income outlook.\nWe still expect net interest income to be flat to down 4% from the annualized fourth-quarter level of $36.8 billion as the benefit of a steeper yield curve has been largely offset by softer-than-anticipated loan demand, low utilization rates on commercial loans, and faster-than-expected prepayments on residential mortgages. That said, it's important to recognize we are still early in the year and our ultimate results for the year will remain dependent on how rate in lending environments evolve. If rates follow the current forward curve and commercial loans grow as the economic recovery gains momentum which is expected by the industry, we would expect NII to land near the high end of the range. However, if loan demand proved softer than expectations, our total loan balance or -- and our total loan balance remains flat compared with where we ended the first quarter, we would expect to finish closer to the middle range.\nWe continue to closely monitor the evolving trends across each of the major drivers and we'll provide updates to our outlook as the year progresses. Turning to expenses on Slide 10. Non-interest expense increased 7% from a year ago, driven by increased personnel expense. Deferred comp expense reduced personnel expenses in the first quarter of last year by $598 million.\nAs a reminder, late in the second quarter of last year, we changed how we hedge deferred compensation which reduced the volatility in our reporting for this item starting in the third quarter of last year. Personnel expense also increased from a year ago from higher incentive and revenue-related compensation, including the impact of higher market valuations on stock-based compensation which was partially offset by lower salaries. All other expense was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower professional services expense due to efficiency initiatives. Our expenses declined 5% from the fourth quarter, a seasonally higher personnel expense was more than offset by lower restructuring charges and operating losses.\nOur 2021 expense outlook is unchanged at approximately $53 billion with lower annualized expenses toward the end of the year. As we've said on our last earnings call, our outlook excludes restructuring charges and the costs of business exits such as the $104 million goodwill writedown related to the sale of student loans. We assumed $1 billion of operating losses in the outlook. The first quarter included $213 million of operating losses.\nBut as you know, these expenses can be lumpy, especially as we continue to resolve legacy issues. We also assumed approximately $500 million of incremental revenue-related expenses as these have been higher than expected so far this year due to strong equity markets, which is a good thing, as revenue more than offsets any increase. If the current market level holds, we would expect incremental revenue-related compensations this year to be approximately $800 million, but we are still early in the year and will update you as the year progresses. We are continuing to execute on efficiency initiatives and additional initiatives continue to be identified and vetted.\nTurning to our business segments starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 11. Net income increased from a year ago driven by revenue growth in home lending and lower provision for credit losses. Consumer and small business banking revenue declined 6% from a year ago, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates and lower deposit-related fees. The decline in deposit-related fees was driven by higher average checking account balances and higher COVID-related fee waivers.\nWe expect a high level of pay -- paycheck protection program loan forgiveness in the second quarter which would result in higher net interest income. But as a -- as a reminder, the fees on those loans originated last year are being donated, so you will see a corresponding increase in donation expense so it won't impact the bottom line. Home lending revenue increased 19% from a year ago on higher retail originations on gain -- on gain on sale margins. The 12% increase from the fourth quarter was primarily due to higher mortgage banking income related to the resecure -- resecuritization of loans we purchased from mortgage-backed securities last year, and an increase in retail originations.\nCredit card revenue declined 2% from both the fourth quarter and a year ago due to lower loan balances reflecting elevated payment rates. We continue to make progress in executing our efficiency initiatives in our branches, transaction volume continues to shift away from our branches with 82% of consumer and small business deposits in the first quarter done digitally, up from 76% a year ago. We've closed 395 branches since the first quarter of 2020, including 90 branches in the first quarter of 2021. We are on track to complete the remainder of the 250 branches we expect to consolidate this year.\nWe've also continued to adjust staffing levels including the reductions related to branch closures. Importantly to date, we've been able to make these adjustments while reducing customer attrition and improving client satisfaction. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 12, our first quarter retail mortgage duration -- origination volume was the highest since 2016. Total mortgage originations increased 8% from a year ago as a $6.7 billion decline in correspondent originations was more than offset by -- by $10.5 billion of higher retail originations.\nTotal mortgage originations declined 4% from the fourth quarter due to the seasonal slowdown in the purchase market and as a growth -- and as growth in retail originations was more than offset by a decline in corresponding originations. While the mortgage origination market is expected to decline in the second quarter as the anticipated increase in the seasonal purchase market is expected to be more than offset by a decline in recent refinancings, we currently expect our origination volume to be robust as we have strong demand in the retail channel and we continue to build up volume in the correspondent, non-conforming market. Auto originations increased 32% from the fourth quarter and 8% from a year ago in a strong market with supply shortages for both new and used cars. With improving economics -- with the improving economic forecasts, we are gradually returning to pre-pandemic -- pre-pandemic underwriting policies.\nTurning to debit card. Purchase volume increased 3% from seasonally strong fourth-quarter levels. Debit card volume increased 20% from a year ago, reflecting higher consumer spending due to stimulus payments and improving economic conditions. And credit card purchase volume declined from seasonally high fourth-quarter levels.\nPurchase volume was up 6% from a year ago as lower year-over-year volume early in the quarter due to continued reductions. And travel and entertainment spend was more than offset by growth in March. Commercial banking net income was up from both the fourth quarter and a year ago due to a decline in the provision for credit losses. Middle-market banking revenue declined 20% from a year ago driven by the impact of lower interest rates, as well as lower loan balances from reduced client demand in line utilization.\nAsset-based lending and leasing revenue grew 7% from a year ago driven by higher net gains and equity securities and our strategic capital business as first -- first-quarter 2020 included impairments due to a decline in market valuations. This was partially offset by lower net interest income in the first quarter 2021 from lower loan balances. Non-interest expense increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher technology spend, partially offset by lower headcount and consulting expense related to efficiency initiatives. Average loans declined for the third consecutive quarter and were down 19% from a year ago as COVID-related charges were repaid and loan demand and credit line utilization remain weak.\nAverage deposits were up 8% from a year ago as stimulus programs have injected significantly -- significant liquidity into the market. Turning to the corporate investment banking business on Slide 14. In banking, revenue declined 6% from a year ago, driven by the impact of lower interest rates and lower deposit balances, and grew 7% from the fourth quarter. The linked quarter growth was driven by a 20% increase in investment banking revenue with strong debt and equity originations, partially offset by a decline in advisory fees from strong fourth-quarter levels.\nCommercial real estate revenue grew 5% from a year ago, primarily due to improved CMBS gain on sale margins, driven by spread tightening, as well as an increase in low-income housing tax credit income. Market revenue increased 19% from a year ago and strong client demand for asset-backed finance products, other credit products, and municipal bonds which was partially offset by lower demand for rates, products, and lower equities and commodities revenue. Average deposits declined 27% and average trading-related assets were down 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by continued actions we've taken to manage under the asset cap. As I mentioned earlier, wealth and investment management results exclude Wells Fargo Asset Management, which is now reported in corporate, and prior periods have been revised.\nNet income declined 18% in the business from the fourth quarter. Revenue grew reflecting higher asset-based fees and higher retail brokerage transactional activity. Expenses were up due to seasonally higher personnel expense. Net -- net income declined 8% from a year ago reflecting the impact of low interest rates and interest income, partially offset by the higher asset-based fees.\nWe ended the first quarter with record client assets of $2 trillion, up 28% from a year ago, reflecting strong market performance. Net flows into advisory account -- accounts improved in the first quarter from a year ago in the fourth quarter. Average deposits were up 19% from a year ago and average loans increased 4% from a year ago, largely due to customer demand for securities-based lending offerings. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results which included $1.2 billion of lower net interest income from a year ago, primarily due to the impact of lower interest rates, offset by a $1.4 billion increase in non-interest income.\nFirst-quarter 2020 included equity impairments in our affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships and results in the first quarter of 2021 included a $208 million gain on the sale to student loans portfolio. Noninterest expense declined from the fourth quarter on lower restructuring charges. And we'll now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first one I wanted to ask about is on NII guidance. So specifically in terms of premium amortization, there's about a $250 million delta between today's level of premium am and where it was a year ago.\nDoes that -- last year's level of about $360 million or so, does that represent, in your mind, a pretty typical level? And then kind of how quickly does it move back down to there?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Scott, it's Mike. You know, I think we -- you really got to remember what happened last year that would have impacted premium amort, right? It was a bit of an abnormal quarter as you sort of got to the end of the quarter. You know, I think from here, I -- I think based on what we're seeing, you know, premium amort probably has peaked in the first quarter and starts to trend down from here. How long it takes to sort of get to a kind of normalized view, I think we'll see over the next -- we'll have -- we'll have a better clarity on that, I think, over the next couple of quarters.\nBut we -- we would expect it to start trending down from here.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK, perfect. Thank you. And then just a separate question. So the lending recovery is kind of a big question for you guys and others.\nI guess, just regardless of what happens with industry trends, maybe if you could speak to where you feel you guys are getting your fair share of -- of loan growth and where -- where you think you might still need to do better. I know you had mentioned, for example, credit card as -- as being very underpenetrated, but just curious to hear broader thoughts there as well.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Look, look, as -- as what you -- you'll probably hear from a lot of folks, you know, the -- the demand across really most -- most commercial client segments has been pretty weak now and -- and probably stabilized, you know, or seems to have stabilized over the last, you know, couple of months. But, you know, but, you know, I think we'll, you know, sort of see how that progresses, you know, into -- into later this quarter. You know, I think as we sort of look at where the opportunity is, as the economy and the momentum in the economy really starts to take off more, it's really across the board in our core client segments.\nYou know, In our middle market, our commercial banking, more broadly, I think there'll be opportunity in kind of the core, you know, large corporate segment, maybe to a lesser degree. But we do really expect to see that commercial banking demand, you know, start to pick up as the economy picks up. And so I would sort of highlight that. You know, I think Charlie has talked a lot about the credit card space.\nI think there'll be growth there. But given sort of the relative size of our portfolio to the balance sheet, I think that -- the impact there will be -- will be modest to the overall size of sort of our -- our loan portfolio.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nAll right. That's perfect. Thank you very much for taking the questions.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning, guys. Just wondering, Mike, if you can kind of just recodify that -- the expense commentary for the year. You said the $53 billion number and then you also talked about the revenue-related lift of about $800 million.\nSo is that just the reset to $53.8 billion, all things equal? I just want to make sure we know what that includes and doesn't include, and -- and how you expect it to -- to traject from here. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Sure, Ken. Thanks for the question. So, you know, if you recall what we -- how we sort of set the $53 billion target, I'll just give you, you know, a little bit of the background there.\nSo -- that we covered last quarter. So embedded in that $53 billion target was an increase of about $0.5 billion of revenue-related expenses and about $1 billion of operating losses sort of embedded in there. And what we excluded from there is the cost to exit the businesses, which you saw a little bit this quarter, the $100 million or so this quarter for -- for the student loans business and any -- any restructuring charges that, you know, come through -- come throughout the year. So as you sort of think about the go-forward piece of it, you know, the $53 billion, we still feel really good about.\nI think that you know, what's putting a little bit of pressure on that is the incremental $300 million of revenue-related expense. So I don't think it's a foregone conclusion that it's -- we're going to be, you know, $300 million higher, but I do think that's putting pressure on the $53 billion. So it's possible we're a little over that if the revenue-related expenses hold, which, by the way, should be a good thing, right, because that means there's plenty of revenue on the other side of that to offset it.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nYeah, sure. Yep. And that was going to be my follow-up, Mike, which is, was the -- the revenue uplift what you had already seen in the first quarter, or is it things that you feel better about going forward that we haven't necessarily seen yet but you're now anticipating a better revenue environment?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. We did see a little bit of it in the -- in the first quarter as equity markets outperformed, I think, everyone's expectations. So if you -- if those market levels hold throughout the rest of the year, that's when you'll see, you know, the rest of that -- that revenue-related comp come in. And so you'll see the revenue associated with it throughout the rest of the year.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. And then I'm sorry, just last one on it. Are you still expecting the end-of-year on expenses to be lower than the beginning, as you had said, also in the fourth quarter, that trajectory still holds directionally?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Yeah. Directionally, that's right. You know, we'll get more benefit from the efficiency initiatives that we're executing later in the year, so that will -- that will sort of impact the run rate.\nAnd I would just, you know, point out and remind people that, you know, we do have a lot of seasonal expenses, you know, that hit the first quarter. And so you sort of need to normalize for those as you go out for the rest of the year as well.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGreat. OK. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. My first question is a clarification question for Mike. Clearly, the market responded to this comment. I think you -- you noted that if, you know, loan growth was going to be -- continue to be tough this year, that you would -- NII would be down 2% from annualized fourth quarter, which I think the market is taking that you're bringing in your NII guide for the year.\nAnd I just wanted to make sure we interpreted that correctly, that it seems like a more realistic outlook for NII now with the curve steepening and perhaps green shoots on loan growth is flat to down 2%.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No, thanks -- thanks, Erika, for the question. You know, our guidance still holds that down -- you know, it's somewhere between flat to the fourth-quarter run rate to down -- to down 4%. And consistent to what we said, you know, in the first quarter, you know, to get to the top of the range, we needed to see -- we need to see some loan growth.\nThat's still the case, you know, although rates have offset some weakness that we've seen so far. You know, and -- and I think to, you know, to get to kind of the middle of the range, you know, we really need rates to kind of hold where they are, and, you know, we -- we won't need a lot of loan growth from here to -- to hit that. But I think there's, you know, plenty of scenarios that you can sort of think through that, you know, put you somewhere else in -- in the range. But, you know, what we tried to give you were a couple kind of realistic data points relative to where you -- where we think it's -- what's possible in terms of where we'll land within the range.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Very helpful. And my second question is -- is for Charlie. You know, Charlie, clearly, the market is reacting to what seems to be a brighter revenue picture for Wells and continued progress in your transition and turnaround, and it feels like it's shrugging off.\nYou know, typically, your stock would be up 3%, you know, after saying that expenses could slip higher, and clearly, the market doesn't care, given the revenue outlook. I guess I'm wondering as we look forward to 2021, you know, and hearing you loud and clear on some of the investments that you -- you're already, you know, planning to make in the consumer side, you know, what are the puts and takes in terms of, you know, a greater bottom line or benefit from the -- the second half of that $8 billion cost savings that you've identified, you know, versus, you know, an economic picture that -- that is clearly brightened even over the past three months. You know, in other words, should we think of your expenses, you know, having a higher floor, let's say, $50 billion to $51 billion as we look out to 2022? And, you know, obviously, that would come with greater efficiencies as revenue continue to improve.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Erika. Listen, I don't think there's anything more that we're going to say in terms of what we would expect expenses to be going forward beyond what Mike covered in his remarks and what we said on last quarter. When we look at the opportunities to continue to drive efficiency in the company, which is really all about just running a better company, those continue to be extremely significant. We laid out, just, you know, on a gross basis, what we thought those opportunities were and our degree of confidence in being able to achieve that, given the level of specificity that we -- that we had in the line of sight.\nAnd I think that still holds true. And over time, you know, we would, you know, expect to continue to find more kind of peeling the onion back. And at the same time, we are investing in the business. And it's on the consumer side.\nIt's on data. It's across the home lending platform, the card platform, our products in the consumer bank, what we're doing in our middle market business with technology account. I mean, I can go on and on of all the things that we're doing. So I think that's all embedded in our statement that, you know, we would expect the fourth quarter in order to get to $53 billion just would clearly be a lower run rate than the $53 billion itself.\nAnd that as we look forward, we hope to see net expense reductions as we continue to drive efficiency while continuing to add investments into the business. So hopefully, that's responsive to what you're asking.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThank you, Charlie. Strong message this quarter. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi, good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nI had a question around how you're thinking about the dividend and the buybacks. We know that post-CCAR stress test, assuming you pass that, that, you know, there's a little bit more room for you to do both of those things. So maybe, if you could give us a sense as to how you would approach the buyback and the dividend decision post stress test. And in particular, you know, what kind of time frame are you thinking about that you would need to optimize the capital structure down to your management targets because you're sitting with a lot of excess capital today, as you know.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure, sure. Well, Mike, why don't I start and then you can pick up? I guess -- I guess we'd start with the dividend. You know, it's not lost on us that our dividend is quite low certainly relative to where we're earning today and as we look forward. And we all know that's a consequence of two things; it's a consequence of the restrictions that were put in place by the Fed in terms of what those limitations were, but it was also a point of view that we had, which was we didn't want to have to, you know, if the environment even would get worse from that point in time, be in a position to have to reduce the dividend again.\nSo we would like to increase the dividend to a more reasonable level. We think about it as targeting a payout ratio, excluding reserve releases and things like that. And then beyond that, it is, you know, investment in the business. It's deploying our capital for our clients and, you know, the difference being buybacks, ultimately, just given the amount of excess capital that we have today.\nAnd, Mike, you can talk a little bit about the timing.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And as you sort of think about, you know, timing, obviously, you know, we've got a lot of, you know, components to sort of think about there, but, you know, you -- you sort of think about it over the next year or so, you know, or year, I think that sort of gets you probably a reasonable -- reasonable time frame to sort of work our way down, you know, assuming, you know, as -- as we've been told, that the restrictions come off and we're -- we're back to sort of a more normal stress capital buffer regime. And so I would sort of think about it over the -- over that -- that time frame, Betsy, in terms of you know, what the timing looks like.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. That --\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd, obviously, some of that's dependent upon CCAR and the results and how that all plays out.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. And on the payout ratios, I mean, the dividend had been on the higher end of the peer group, but your peer group is running somewhere between, you know, 30% and 40%. And -- and that's, you know, I would -- I would think what you mean by reasonable. I'm not asking you to tell me what ratio, but -- but -- but I guess I'm asking you, is -- is that the right peer group? Or would you say, you know, you should widen your aperture a little bit and go more like 25% to 40%, bring in some of the, you know, G-SIBs in there?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No, look, I think -- I think, you know, as you sort of think about the -- the payout ratio over time, you know, I think, you know, we'll -- we'll sort of come up. And, you know, obviously, it's going to be a board decision, Betsy, in terms of, you know, what -- what the -- what dividend trajectory sort of looks like. But -- but it's not lost on us that we need to sort of be in a reasonable sort of payout range over -- over time.\nAnd obviously, that's going to be dependent upon what we think the earnings capacity is going to look like. And so I think you'll -- you'll see that sort of come through over -- over time and as we sort of, you know, have more ability to distribute capital.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks a lot.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. And I guess I would just add, Betsy, just real quick is, I think the way you -- I mean, I think the numbers and whatnot, the way you talked about it is generally the right way to think about it in terms of how -- I mean, number one, we were clearly high relative to, you know, what others were and in terms of what we, you know, probably make sense for us. That's not the way we're thinking about it. You know, more long-term range in terms, I think what you talked about is right.\nYou know, we would like to, you know, do something sooner rather than later. And that might not get us to where we ultimately want to be, but it would be, I think, an important step that, that's the direction that we're going.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. Thanks so much for the color, Charles and Mike. Appreciate it.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. Just on the margin front, I just wanted to see if you could quantify the impact of the hedge ineffectiveness on the -- on the minute charged in this quarter? And -- and separately, could you just talk about margin expectations from here just given the rate backdrop as we're looking or looking at a bottom here, we could see some upside as we move through the rest of the year? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, sure, John. It's Mike. You know, the -- the he --hedge ineffectiveness had about a 3-basis-point impact on -- on net interest margin. And -- and as you probably know, you know, we'll get that back, her negative 3-basis-point impact and -- and we'll get that back over time.\nThese are -- you know, hedging effectiveness is sort of a temporary difference that, you know, comes back. You know, as you sort of look -- think about the -- the outlook from here, you know, if -- if the case that we sort of laid out that gets us to the top of our NII range plays out in the way we -- the way that underpins that, then, you know, we should -- we should see some growth in both NII and NIM from here. And so this -- this hopefully will be either -- either bottom or pretty close to the bottom as you sort of look forward if that -- if that case plays out. Now, as you know, NIM can move around a little bit quarter to quarter, so you might have that bounce around.\nBut -- but the general trajectory, you know, should be -- should be positive.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. Got it, Mike. Thanks. And then last, separately, on the cost savings side.\nI know you expect about $1.5 billion to fall to the bottom line of the $3.7 billion this year. Can you maybe help us think about the magnitude that fall to the bottom line of the remaining savings of the remaining $4.3 billion as a received? Any -- any additional color you can drive this quarter now that you're beginning to peel the onion as you noted earlier. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, John. I would just go back to what we just talked about a few minutes ago. You know, as you sort of think about the trajectory of the expenses, you know, we'll get more of that impact as we go throughout the year. And as Charlie just mentioned, the run rate as we go into the fourth quarter will be, you know, a lower -- at, you know, at a lower rate.\nAnd as we sort of think about the investments we need to make and -- and -- and al -- also the additional efficiency initiatives that we, you know, we vet into our working on on top of what we talked about last quarter, you know, play out, you know, we'll provide more guidance on that, you know, as we think about 2022 when -- when we get later in the year.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd this is Charlie, I just want to add a couple of things if I can. You know, first of all, I just remind everyone that, you know, we have a tremendous amount of work to do on our control environment. And when you look at the consent orders and all those things, and so, no one has asked about that. And again, it's -- there's really very little that we can say, as I said in my prepared remarks, but we have a lot of work to do.\nWe're going to sp -- we're committed to spend whatever is necessary. And it's -- it's -- it's -- it is a significant amount of money. And as we get into next year, we're not going to lock ourselves into a certain number because we have to spend what's appropriate. And so as we get closer, we'll be in a better position to give you more color.\nBut, you know, it's -- you know, given it's in a three quarters away, it just doesn't make any sense. And I also just want to -- just remark, you know, we are very focused on improving efficiency of the company. But the world is moving really quickly. We have a lot of work to do in terms of building the businesses and putting ourselves in a position so that we do create the kind of revenue growth that we would expect to able to get out of this franchise.\nAnd so that's, you know, just a reminder, part of the reason why we're not being too specific about what we expect beyond this year because as we continue to do our work and plan for the future, we need to have the ability to do what's necessary to build the company for the long term while we've still said we still would expect expenses to be down on a net basis as we look into the out years. But more to come as time goes on.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. All right. Thanks, Charlie.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGood morning, everyone. You know, Charlie, we've talked a lot about the businesses and becoming more efficient if you will in focusing on those that impact your -- your strategic priorities. Are there any businesses that you would like to increase your critical mass in or new businesses to get into that you think would be helpful to your strategic priorities?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYou know, I think -- so when you're -- looking at the first point, I think, you know, the -- when we look at these, you know, four businesses that we report publicly, we generally believe that there are material growth prospects in all of them, all for very, very different reasons. And so, you know, it's hard to sit here today and say whether, you know, one should be a little bit higher than the others. But I think we feel great about the positions we have. We feel great about the opportunities in each.\nAnd so I think that is -- that should be a -- you know, that's an honest assessment of the way we view our businesses. What was the second part of the question again? I'm. sorry.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nYou know, just -- are there any holes or any opportunities that you see to increase critical mass in any specifics in any of those business lines? You know, just thinking about any areas where if you had some excess capital, could you -- could you invested there to -- to gain some -- some -- some market share, enhance your goal to improve your strategic priority outlook?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, I think -- I think all the things that we have to do at this point are continuing to, you know, build out the products and services that we have at the core of the franchise. I mean, you know, we are -- we're -- you know, we're spending a significant amount of money and think we've got a significant opportunity given the size of our consumer footprint and terms of what we should be doing from a digital perspective. You know, the way we kind of look at it internally is we're -- we're in the game, but we're not at all a market leader in terms of what our digital capabilities are. We have a very, very clear roadmap about what we intend to build out, and we would start to be bringing those things to market this year.\nBut as I -- you know, as I said, when we talk about what we're spending this year and that $53 billion, you know, that is included in there. And we've got opportunities like that across all the businesses, so I think, you know, we're -- you know, we're not in a position to buy anything at this point. Our focus is on, you know, spending our money to strengthen what we have, but still believes that there are material opportunities to do that, some shorter term and some longer term.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you, Charlie, appreciate the color.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. Just a long-term strategic question. You know, trying to look past the asset cap and everything. As we think about the investment bank, you know, what is the vision for that longer term? You've got a competitive advantage in the SLR, you know, which is becoming more and more evident with the Fed exemption going away.\nI think you're about 100 -- 150 basis points above peers. Is there a way to better leverage that? And then maybe if you just offer comment on the equity trading, and let's not use numbers, but, you know, was that impacted by a hedge fund out there?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo let me -- let me start. You know, I think our -- our aspirations, you know, in -- in the -- for our corp investment bank, it's actually interesting because, actually, other than the fact that we're not afraid to talk about it, I actually don't think about it being really all that different from what we've been doing over, you know, the past bunch of years. When you look at our results, you know, the corporate investment bank is an extremely important part of the company. That's not because I declare anything differently.\nAll we did is we broke out the results so you actually saw the importance of it. A significant part of it is the corporate bank. But the investment bank is a meaningful portion of it as well. And so as we think about, you know, what it should look like going forward, we want to continue to build out the corporate investment bank as we've been doing in a very linear way, not in an exponential way, not, you know, moving beyond our risk appetite that kind of defines what Wells Fargo is.\nBut just by serving the existing customers that we have in most parts of the company in a much more holistic way. And ultimately, over a period of time, that does allow you to expand your reach in terms of what your client base is. And so we're focused on, you know, the products and services that, you know, what predominantly U.S. customers want from us.\nWe've talked about the opportunities to penetrate the corporate investment banking products into the middle market. But it's true of, you know, there are significant opportunities in the large corporate market in the U.S. where we've got, you know, significant treasury management relationships, material lending relationships, and we're completely underpenetrated in terms of what fees are for -- for those customers relative to -- at other institutions. So that's the way we think about it.\nAnd again, I would just stress. It's a -- it's a continuation of, you know, building it out in a methodical way, not focusing on using risk in order to group -- to grow share, but focusing on our customer relationships that we have because we have a shot. And just to be clear, on -- on the equity piece that you're talking about. Just remember, we -- you know, we do have an equity platform, which you can see in our results.\nI would just describe in terms of our prime brokerage business. I'm sure we'll get a question on it. So just to answer it now, our -- our exposure in total and our individual exposures, I would describe it as just very consistent with the size of our platform. You know, we manage it the way we -- in terms of risk, the way we manage all the risks in the corporate investment bank and, you know, I think we've seen, you know, the results over a period of time there in terms of what that means because it's not just what you do, it's how you do it.\nAnd so we did have a relationship with Arcagos. We said publicly that we were always well-collateralized. We exited it -- we exited it with all of our exposure with no loss. And I'll just add that we had substantial excess collateral after liquidation.\nSo it just says, you know, again, in terms of the way we think about how we want to manage businesses that have risk in it, you know, not that all will be perfect all the time. And as is the case in all events, you know, there are lessons to be learned both in terms of what we've done and what others have done and, you know, we'll factor that into how we manage the businesses as -- as we always would.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd -- and I -- I would just add just one thing as you sort of think about our growth from here. We are a bit constrained in growing our investment bank with the asset cap restrictions that we have in place, you know, given the significant growth that we've seen in consumer deposits in particular. So -- so as you sort of think about that timeline and that -- that approach Charlie said, that'll take some time to sort of play out.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, just to reiterate. You know, that -- you know, as we look at the actions that we've had to take to accommodate all the liquidity that we've seen, the corporate investment bank has bear the biggest brunt in terms of where we've actually gone to create a bunch of that capacity. So as we think about the future, you know, the first step is actually just getting back to where we were. So.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nAnd then just to clarify, the decline in equity trading year over year, it's not just -- if it wasn't from Arcago, is that distortion from the retirement? There -- there's some noise I think related to that in a year ago comp. Was that what's driving that?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, it -- it's just -- it's just activity levels in our business, and, you know, our business is a little bit different than others, a little bit smaller cash business that sort of I think drove a lot of activity this quarter. So -- so I think there's a number of factors sort of -- sort of driving and no -- no individual sort of item that's significant.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK, thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question for Mike just on the fee income outlook. You know, lots of moving pieces in the quarter. But how should we be thinking about the appropriate jumping-off point for core fee income, you know, as we think about the completion of the business sales and maybe some normalization in IB and mortgage activity? I know there's more explicit guidance has been given on the NII side.\nI was hoping you can maybe unpack how we should be thinking about that core fee income run rate from here pro forma the completion of those sales.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So -- so obviously, we've given you, you know, a lot of detail on those sales, so you can model in, you know, the impact that -- that that's going to have on -- on fee come -- fee income pretty -- you know, pretty easily. As you sort of think about some of the other, you know, big line items underneath that, you know, you know, we had about $2.8 billion in the quarter for advisory and other asset-based fees primarily in our -- our -- our wealth business. And as you start to think about the key driver there, it's going to be equity market levels, and so you can model, you know, what you think's going to happen there, plus -- you know, plus flows that may come in.\nAs you said, you know, another $1.3 billion in the mortgage business. You know, that is a bit cyclical as -- as you sort of pointed out. But, you know, given what we're -- what we see at this point for the second quarter, we expect to have robust origination volumes in our -- in our business. And so that should be a good -- a good quarter at least.\nAnd as -- as rates continue to rise, you'll see some impact there in terms of, you know, volume impact there. You know, as you look at some of the other pieces, you've got deposit and lending fees, but just under a couple billion dollars there too. I think those are pressured in the short run, you know, but should see some normalization and growth over time. You've got card fees which should grow with economic activity.\nAnd then you've got another couple billion that's kind of, you know, I'd kind of characterize as more transactional in nature, whether it's commissions or investment banking fees. And so I think if you sort of think about it that way, you can -- you can probably, you know, come up with a few or a few drivers that sort of help you model that in a way that gives you some -- that gives you a view on where it's -- where it's headed.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThanks for -- thanks for that color. And just for my follow-up onNII, maybe focusing on liquidity deployment. You guys are in -- are in a very strong excess liquidity position. I know that a couple of quarters ago and I think, Mike, it was actually your predecessor who alluded to the fact that your appetite was tepid to redeploy some of that excess into securities just given, at that point in time, the curve was flat as a pancake.\nNow that we've seen some incremental steepening, would you tell me you could speak to what's contemplated in the NII guidance in terms of excess liquidity deployment, and your appetite to actually grow the securities book from here just giving your liquidity capacity to do so?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, no. As you point out we've got plenty of capacity and I think you know as you look at what happened in the quarter, you know, kind of in a marginal way, you know, a little under $10 billion, we've increased the portfolio. So we've started to re -- redeploy a bit of it. But as you sort of point out, although the curve has steepened, you know, rates are still relatively low and so we're -- we're working to balance for the short-term carry we're gonna get, you know, by redeploying faster with, you know, OCI impacts over time and how to do this in the most effective way and -- and when we get good entry points where we're taking advantage of it.\nSo I would -- I would -- I would think that we're going to -- we're going to continue to redeploy at a -- at a -- at a prudent pace as we see opportunities that sort of makes sense from not just the, you know, short-term carry view but also all the other, you know, all the other items that we've sort of need to take into account as we sort of look forward.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThat's great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul, you may be on mute.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nSorry about that. I was on mute. Mike, I believe you mentioned that the expenses -- some of the expenses associated with the asset management business and the corporate trust business will be sticky and will -- will remain for a bit and we're talking about -- about, you know, annual in 2020 about $1.7 billion in aggregate. What still a little bit unclear to me is -- is in the $53 billion expense number, what proportion of that $53 billion or -- or $1.7 billion is embedded in the -- in the $53 billion guide? And I guess as an adjunct to that, I guess, can you just talk about how sticky those expenses, how you know what proportion of those expenses will stick around? How do they roll off over of what time period? Because I guess what I'm a little bit sensitive to is with the sale of the -- the three businesses, you're creating about $2.3 billion revenue hole, and you know, you just want to make sure that there -- that we understand that there's no notable impact on -- on the expense base.\nSo if you can just help us unpack some of this stuff that would be helpful.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, no. It's a -- it's a good question. So as you sort of think about corporate trust and asset management, we assume that those expenses would be here for the full year and the $53 billion. So there's no -- no savings assumed relative to the outlook we -- we gave you.\nSo that sort of, I guess, point number one. On -- on the other parts of the question, you know, what we were trying to point out is, you know, with both of these businesses, you know, probably, you know, certainly, for the corporate trust business to maybe a greater degree, we'll have some transition -- transition services agreements. You know, as they -- as they take on and migrate these businesses to some of the expenses stay, some of that will get offset and in other items, but some of the expenses will stay as part of those agreements so not everything transitions sort of day one, that sort of point number one. Point number two on it is that, you know, as you would expect there's a -- a portion of these expenses that are more shared across the organization.\nI use a corporate overhead just as an example. So it'll take us a little longer to work the majority of that out. And so I'd characterize that as, you know, somewhere between 10% to 20% of it will take a little bit longer. And then, I guess lastly, as we sort of get to closing on these deals, will -- we'll be transparent and provide an update to our guidance on -- on how these will impact.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. But if -- if we're thinking about 2022 in relation to the -- to the sort of ongoing expense run rate, which was reflected in the $53 billion, really the, you know, the $1.7 billion. I'm just looking at the asset management corporate trust, that the bulk of that should, by that point assuming the deal's closed, should call it, I don't know, 80%, 90% of that should be -- should be out of a run rate by next year.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, sub -- subject to any trend -- any impact from transition services agreement.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. Right.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nAs we get -- as we get closer we'll give you more --\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nWhich were really paid for in revenue?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYep, yep. Yeah. As Charlie said, in most -- in most cases for these transition service agreements will have some expense still there but we'll get reimbursed, and the way the accounting works on that as it's just geography. You know, we'll get some revenue and offset by these expenses.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nIs there a reason why these are not placed in discontinued operations until the deal closed -- closes?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think, we -- we moved the asset management to corporate. And so you know, we moved it out of the segment that it's in. And as I noted on the call, we'll -- we'll move corporate trust out of the commercial banking segment in the second quarter. So you'll have you'll be able to clearly see sort of the impact of it in the operating segments.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. All right. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHey, Mike. Two quick cleanup items on a tax rate. Can you remind us what's making the tax rate low this year and whether the reserve releases put some upward pressure on that and then more importantly what -- is it sustainably low? As you look into further years because of tax-advantaged investments or is part of the profitability related? Just give us the -- the factors there.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. The -- the biggest -- the biggest impact, John, on the tax rate, you know, relative to kind of the marginal rate that we've got is the impact we get from the tax credits we get on our low-income housing and renewable energy investments. And -- and as you can see from the K disclosures, those are -- those have been growing year after year and they grew -- they will -- we expect them to grow in 2021 as well. And those are -- those -- those are what they are, right? There's no, you know, those -- those are pretty easy for us to identify and forecast and -- and that's the biggest piece of what's bringing down the -- the effective tax rate and that -- those will -- those credits will continue.\nObviously, more -- the more pre-tax income that we have, you know, above and beyond what we expect will sort of be at the marginal tax rate. And so, presumably, if we -- we, you know, obviously, theoretically, if we earn more money then you'll see that effective tax rate sort of inch up over -- overtime.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nAnd then, just on the mortgage outlook you mentioned --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, John. This is Charlie. I only want to add on that, and Mike you can correct me. The -- the reserve releases affect the rate but the size of our total tax number, not that big.\nAgain, the substantial impact on the lower rate is the dollar benefit that we get from these tax-advantaged investments that we have. And as Mike said, just on income going forward, think about it in terms of the marginal rate.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nYeah. Got it. So you still expecting a single-digit tax rate this year, Mike, correct?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, yeah. You know, at this point that -- that's the case.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And then, just to clarify on the mortgage outlook, Mike, I think you said like the industry, you know, might be down in volume but you guys expect to bump that a little bit because of some of the retail strength you have or you kind of just saying that you'll be down a little bit but still robust? If you could just clarify your outlook on mortgage that would be great.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Look, at the industry data, you know, typically their forecast lags a little bit relative to what the industry is actually seeing. And so I think the industry is projecting that the second quarter is going to be down a little bit but we'll -- we'll see how that sort of plays out over the coming weeks in terms of what their forecasts are. But I think based on what we're seeing in our pipeline, you know, we feel like it'll be a -- a pretty robust quarter on the origination side.\nYou're likely to see that gain on sale margins come down but we -- we're likely to see an increase in -- in volume as well. So --\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with J.P. Morgan.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nHi, Charlie, Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of clean-up ones. Just a little bit further on mortgage banking.\nMike, you just answer that part -- partly. The question I have is Ginnie Mae buyouts, you talked about that boosting your mortgage banking gains how much was that? And because then that could give us a sense of what did your gain on sale margin do in Q1 versus Q4. And how much are you expecting that gain on sale margin, I'm sorry, the Ginnie Mae buyouts to -- to help with with the next couple of quarters, how much more to do?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I think, you know, Vivek, I don't have the -- I don't have the number in front of me on the impact from -- from the buyouts but I -- but I would also sort of point out so we can follow-up after. But I would also point out that, you know, the early -- the early buyouts as we -- we resecure -- resecuritize them that impact sort of our -- our balance sheet as well, sort of our loan balance in home lending. And so I think that's another big driver and we give you some data in the queues in terms of what those -- what those balances look like quarter to quarter. So we would expect that over the coming quarters that we're going to continue to re -- resecuritize more of -- more of those loans.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. And then, a second one for both of you. I saw the numbers on the expected gain on sale in the businesses. Well, the asset management and corporate trust.\nIs that net of goodwill or is that -- would you need to adjust a goodwill writedown on that? And that will obviously play into your share -- share buybacks. And Charlie, given that we're all anticipating the asset cap to be lifted at some point, how are you thinking about the pace of share buybacks since, you know, that'll give you an opportunity to put some of that capital to work in terms of growing the balance sheet too? Don't worry I'm not -- I'm not trying to pin you down on -- on that timing of asset cap getting lifted, but just --\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So, Vivek, I'll -- I'll start there. So you know I want to get wonky on accounting but, you know, the -- the way we accounted for the student loan business was a sale of the portfolio and so there was a goodwill writedown that showed discretely in -- in the P&L and how that flows through. As you sort of look at the corporate trust business sale and the asset management sale, you won't have a corresponding writedown of the goodwill.\nThe gains net of -- of all -- everything that goes into exiting -- exiting there. So you don't need to adjust for, you know, for -- for that. You know, I -- I think that as it comes, you know, comes to sort of the asset cap question we'll go back to our stock answer around, you know, not sort of not commenting on -- on that at all other than the fact that, you know, as Charlie has said a couple of times on the call that, you know, where it's our top priority and we're continuing to do whatever we need to do to sort of work our way through that and we continue to believe we're making -- we're making good progress there. And as you sort of look at, you know, our capital and liquidity levels, you know, we've got, you know, a significant continue to have a significant amount of excess capital.\nSo --\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nYeah. All right. Thanks.\nOperator\nOur final question will come from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nYeah. I have two questions, one on cards and one on NII. On the card front, you mentioned that you are punching below your weight. And just curious what you're hearing from a lot of the card companies and J.P.\nMorgan this morning that they're going to really accelerate their marketing spend on cards in the second half of the year. So are you expecting to grow? How are you expecting to gain market share? Is it pricing, awards? How -- how are you going to improve your -- your relative position in that business?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nCharles, this is -- this is Charlie. Thanks for the question. I would say -- first of all I would say, again, kind of like my comments on the corporate investment bank. When we think about the opportunity we're not talking about doing anything that is materially different from a risk perspective for the company.\nThe way we look at it is we have a business today which has $35-ish billion of receivables. When you look at the size of the consumer base that we touch across the franchise, it's hugely substantial and hugely under-penetrated even though we do have a, you know, a -- a reasonable size business to start out with. Ultimately, when you look at what we do as a card company, the fact is our card propositions are not competitive. What if it is available today in the marketplace or where people are going.\nWhen we look at our -- the things that we do on fraud, when we look at our customer service, every step of the way we think we have opportunities to make material improvements in what our offerings look like, which will make our products far more attractive for those that currently have the products so that it becomes their primary product but also more attractive for the customers that we currently touch. And so you know, it's a very, very -- it's where -- we're very, very clear about what we think we've got to do to increase that penetration in a lot of ways. It's very, very basic because we're building on something which is particularly uncompetitive, which I just look at like it creates a great opportunity for us.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nAnd as -- as a follow-up question on NII, I believe you guys haven't modeled scenarios for negative rates at the short end. Can you share some of your findings on that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Negative -- negative rates in the short end won't have a significant impact on us at all. You know, I think we all -- we have the outlet at the Fed at -- at 10 basis points and so I don't -- I don't see that being an impact for us.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nI'll now turn the conference back over to management for any concluding remarks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThis is Charlie again. I just want to thank everyone for the time and we look forward to talking to you during the quarter and then on the call -- on the call next quarter.

My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo second-quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss second-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our second-quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie. \nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you, John. I'm going to open the call by reviewing what is clearly a very poor quarter for us. I will review the drivers of our results, make some comments about the environment, and discuss the rationale for the intended dividend reduction.\nI'll then turn the call over to John to review second-quarter results in more detail. Our view of the length and severity of the downturn deteriorated considerably from our assumptions at the end of the first quarter, and this, as well as the knock-on impacts from COVID, substantially impacted our results this quarter. We added $8.4 billion to the allowance for credit losses. Charge-offs increased $204 million from the prior quarter to $1.1 billion.\nNet interest income was down 13% from the prior quarter, driven primarily by lower rates. The constraints of operating under the asset cap has limited our ability to offset lower rates with balance sheet growth. And we actually took actions during the quarter to limit loan and deposit growth, which John will highlight. Expenses included approximately $400 million related to decisions we made due to COVID, most of which we do not expect to be permanent but was the right thing to do for employees and to improve the safety of our facilities; about $350 million of deferred comp with an offset in fee revenue; $1.2 billion of operating losses, primarily for customer remediation accruals related to our ongoing work to remediate the historical issues in Community Banking as we took another look under new leadership at outstanding matters.\nThis accrual will enable us to do the right thing for our customers while resolving these matters as quickly as possible. Revenues were lower by about $295 million due to COVID-related fee and interest waivers for certain products. In addition, a strong quarter of mortgage production revenue was partially offset by a $531 million writedown of our mortgage servicing rights asset due to higher projected defaults and faster prepayment assumptions. And while it's a smaller part of the company, we did have record revenues this quarter in our corporate and investment bank.\nEven with the loss this quarter, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.9% from 10.7% last quarter and is well above our regulatory minimum of 9%. As a reminder, our regulatory minimum reflects our expected stress capital buffer of 2.5%, the minimum possible. As you know, Wells Fargo is predominantly a U.S. bank that takes deposits and mixed loans.\nOur balance sheet composition is 80% cash loans in our investment portfolio. When consumers, small businesses, middle-market companies, and corporate suffer, we do as well. As the economic environment brought on by COVID negatively impacts our customers and clients, it will filter through to our results, primarily in the form of outsized credit losses and compressed net interest margins. Additionally, given we operate with a balance sheet cap, we must prioritize balance sheet capacity, both assets and deposits.\nAnd there is certainly an opportunity cost for us in an environment like this. In addition, given the uncertainty and the recovery, we must manage the balance sheet to a level where we can remain below the asset cap, even if there's another period of material loan drawdowns or upward pressure on our deposit base. Having said that, we are responsible for the position we're in. The balance sheet cap exists because leadership failed to both oversee and build the appropriate infrastructure of the company, and our financial underperformance is because leadership didn't make the difficult decisions necessary.\nWe are focused on both of these. We still have much to do to build the right risk and control foundation, which is what our regulators expect, and nothing can or will stand in the way of those activities. It is our highest priority. But we also recognize that we've been extremely inefficient for too long, and we will begin to take decisive actions, none of which will impact our risk and regulatory work, to increase our margins.\nTo the first point, we continue to make meaningful changes to improve the foundation of the company. In the second quarter, we announced a corporate risk organizational structure to provide greater oversight of all risk-taking activities and a more comprehensive view of risk across the company. Our new risk model will have five line of business chief risk officers to complement the teams and leaders by risk type. During the quarter, we hired a new chief operational risk officer, a new chief risk officer for consumer lending, and a chief control executive.\nWe continue to add additional talent to the senior leadership team. Since I joined the company nine months ago, I've announced six new members to the operating committee, all coming from outside of Wells Fargo with strong and relevant industry experience. Over two-thirds of our operating committee have joined Wells Fargo since 2018. All of our business lines' CEOs are now in place, including Mike Weinbach, who joined Wells Fargo in May as CEO of Consumer Lending; and Barry Sommers, who joined at the end of June as CEO of Wealth and Investment Management.\nLester Owens will be joining us next week in a newly created role as head of operations. Lester has more than 30 years of experience in the financial services industry and senior operations roles. He will be responsible for building a more integrated approach to Wells Fargo's business operations functions. He has a proven track record in delivering a better customer experience while driving substantial efficiencies at the same time.\nWe also made significant hires and roles rundown from our operating committee, including a new head of government relations, corporate communications and corporate responsibility, as well as chief administrative officer, and a new head of our home lending businesses. We continue to have over 200,000 employees working from home, and we plan to have employees who are currently working from home continue to do so until at least September. It is too early to determine exactly when we will ultimately return to a more traditional work environment, but we will be cautious about bringing people back into the office. While I do believe there are meaningful benefits of people working physically together, we will move forward when we are comfortable that the health risks are manageable.\nWhere there is a specific need, we will do so with the appropriate safety precautions in place, and we will make these decisions by geography, by facility. We have done this since the beginning of the crisis, and we will continue to do so and serve our customers and communities. We've made significant accommodations for our customers. Through the end of June, we have helped more than 2.7 million consumer and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees.\nThis includes over $2.5 million payment deferrals, representing more than $5 billion in principal and interest, including $3.2 billion in mortgage loans serviced for others. We provided approximately 6 million fee waivers for consumer and small business customers exceeding $200 million. For our commercial clients, we processed approximately 246,000 deferrals, representing more than $1.5 billion of principal and interest payments. In addition, for commercial distribution and auto finance customers, we provided maturity date extensions, representing approximately $6.6 billion of outstanding principal and interest.\nThrough the end of June, we have funded 179,000 PPP loans totaling $10.1 billion with an average loan size of $6,000. 60% of those were for loan amounts of less than $25,000, 84% of those were for companies that had fewer than 10 employees, 90% have less than $2 million in annual revenues, and 41% were to companies in low- and moderate-income areas or at least 50% minority census tracks. And we announced last week our Open For Business Fund. We have committed to donating approximately $400 million in gross processing fees earned from the Payroll Protection Plan to help support businesses impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAnd we will work with nonprofit organizations to provide capital, technical support and long-term resiliency programs to small businesses with an emphasis on serving minority-owned businesses. Customer deposits have continued to increase, reflecting unprecedented government stimulus programs, lower spending and customers converting investments into cash while commercial deposits declined, reflecting actions we took to manage under the asset cap, which John will describe in more detail. In March, our commercial customers utilized over $80 billion of their loan commitments during the market turbulence at the onset of the pandemic, and almost all of those loans were paid down in the second quarter. Debit card spend started to increase in April and returned to pre-COVID levels in May.\nAnd in the last full week of June, were up approximately 10% from the same week a year ago. Consumer credit card spend improved steadily starting in mid-April but was still down approximately 10% from a year ago as of the end of June. Commercial card spend remained significantly lower throughout the second quarter and was still down over 30% in the last full week of June compared to the same week a year ago, with declines across industry segments. We continue to monitor our consumer and commercial customer spending trends as the nation goes through the various stages of reopening.\nTrends in digital usage are strong. Mobile deposit dollar volume was up over 100% in the second quarter compared with a year ago. In the second quarter, digital log-ins were up 21% from a year ago. Let me turn to the dividend now.\nToday, we announced that our board expects to reduce our dividend for the third quarter to $0.10 per share. The Federal Reserve has authorized banks to pay common stock dividends that do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the bank's net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. Based on these instructions, we previously announced that this limitation would cause us to reduce dividend from the current level of $0.51 a share. In addition, while this requirement currently applies to the third quarter, the Federal Reserve stated it reserves the right to extend the limitations as it learns more about the evolution of the COVID event.\nSeparately from this, our board has been reviewing the level of the dividend, and I've discussed a way in which we would approach evaluating the right go-forward level. We first would look at our capital position. As I said, our capital position remains quite strong, so our current capital level is not the driving factor in our decision. Having said that, as we look forward, we do not pretend to have a deeper understanding of the path of the recovery than others.\nUsing our economic assumptions, our capital levels remain above the minimum required, and our CCAR results confirm the strength of capital position. But we believe it's prudent to note that our assumptions are just that, so we felt it was appropriate to factor this uncertainty into our thinking around the appropriate dividend level in this environment. After evaluating our capital position, we considered our current and expected earnings level. We expect the impact of COVID to continue to negatively impact our earnings until we see a clear trend of meaningful improvements in unemployment and GDP.\nThis will result in continued lower levels of NII and certain economically sensitive fee revenues, as well as potentially unforeseen expenses to operate in this environment. In addition, while our ACL is intended to cover expected losses based on our current economic assumptions, we're mindful of the uncertainty and the need to reevaluate these assumptions continually, and I will discuss this more. But while we have actively begun to address the fact that our expenses are significantly too high, it will take some time to see the impact of our actions in our results. Putting this all together, it is critical in these uncertain times that our common stock dividend reflects current earnings capacity, assuming a continued difficult operating environment, evolving regulatory guidance, and protects our capital position if economic conditions were to further deteriorate.\nGiven this, we believe it's prudent to be extremely cautious until we see a clear path to broad economic improvement. We're confident that this eventual economic improvement, combined with our actions to increase our margins, will allow our wonderful franchise to support a higher dividend in the future. We're extremely disappointed to take this action and do understand that many rely on this stream of income. However, we must be prudent in this environment.\nI have acknowledged in the past that our expenses are too high and that we're building road maps to improve our efficiency ratio. To repeat, there is nothing structurally different about Wells Fargo that should prevent us from being as efficient as our large peers, but we are far from it. For us to bring our level of efficiency close to our peers, the math would tell you we need to eliminate over $10 billion of expenses. While our work is not yet complete to commit to specific numbers and time frames, we expect to take a series of actions beginning in the second half of the year to begin to reduce our expense base and bring our expenses in line with the size and composition of our businesses.\nThis will be a multiyear effort for sure but would like to see a reduction in expenses next year. And we now have a centralized team driving the effort across the enterprise, and our lines of business and functional areas have dedicated resources stacked against this. This work did not start in the last few months, but the extremely challenging operating environment and uncertain outlook has accelerated our sense of urgency. It is important to note that I deeply believe that this exercise is about making us a better and more efficient company, not just about reducing expenses.\nWe have too many management layers, spans of controls for managers are too narrow, and we have resources dedicated to activities that are not a priority today. This cannot continue. We also have the opportunity to apply lessons we have learned since the onset of the pandemic to drive efficiency across the company. Over the medium term, we have the opportunity to materially reduce our expense, including increasing digital adoption for retail and commercial clients; reducing third-party spend; consolidating locations, including branches, field offices and corporate sites; and at applying technology differently.\nIn addition, the opportunity to consolidate our operational platforms is still meaningful. As a financial company and, specifically, a G-SIB we must be strong financially to serve our customers and support our communities but also to provide growing opportunities for our employees. And while our balance sheet is strong, our margins are too narrow. To ensure we're that source of strength, we need to begin to take action to improve our results.\nAs I've said, and I'll say it again, we will not do anything that will impact the work we have under way to build out our risk and control environment. The opportunity to become more efficient exists elsewhere in the organization, and we will protect this work at all costs. I will continue to share more specifics about our plans as they develop, and we will be talking more about this next quarter. While there remains much economic uncertainty, many market liquidity trends are strong as Fed programs continue to effectively support the smooth functioning of the capital markets.\nWhile still wide to pre-crisis levels, market spreads have continued to improve since the peak of the dislocation and have retraced 70% to 90% of their mid-March widening. Liquidity and treasury and interest rate swap markets returned to pre-crisis levels, and the Fed's open market purchase program has stabilized mortgage basis valuations and improved liquidity. HQLA bid-ask, a measure of the cost to transfer risk, has retraced to pre-crisis levels, while measures of volatility are now below pre-crisis levels. However, the economic recovery will not be smooth.\nMuch of the economy is still essentially closed or just beginning to open, and additional restrictions are being implemented as the spread of the virus continues to increase in many areas of the world. While consumer spending has increased from levels at the end of the first quarter, it is still down from a year ago with significant declines in areas like travel, entertainment and restaurants. And while government stimulus programs provided a safety net for many, they are scheduled to run off, raising the possibility of more economic hardship ahead. Having said all of this, cities, communities, people and businesses are all learning what it takes to reopen safely, and there is progress on vaccines and therapeutics.\nWe will do what we can to support the fastest recovery possible, but we will be cautious in our outlook until we see the facts. I want to conclude my comments today by discussing an important topic: racial injustice. In my conversations with different groups over the past months, the pain and frustration with the lack of progress within both our country and Wells Fargo is clear. Inequality and discrimination has been clearly exposed and must not continue.\nWells Fargo has not been effective in creating enough diversity or a consistently inclusive environment, and I've outlined a number of actions we are taking around race to change the outcomes, including creating a new role which will have a broad mandate of driving diversity and inclusion in both the workplace but also our business. We'll be evaluating operating committee members based upon their progress in improving diverse representation and inclusion in their area of responsibility, and it will have a direct impact on year-end compensation decisions. And we've announced the donation of these gross processing fees for PPP, estimated to be approximately $400 million. This is just the beginning of the work needed to address this crisis and to meaningfully contribute to the change that is necessary.\nBut I believe that this is a watershed moment, and we will be part of making sure this time is different. Finally, I want to thank all of the employees at Wells Fargo who continue to work tirelessly to serve our customers and successfully execute on our priorities. I will now turn the call over to John.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Charlie's comments covered most of the information on Page 2 of the supplement, including the largest driver of our reported loss, which was the $8.4 billion increase in the allowance for credit losses in the second quarter. So let me highlight just a couple of things here. First, our income taxes in the second quarter reflected the impact of annual income tax benefits, primarily tax credits, driven by our reported pre-tax loss.\nAs a result, we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the remainder of the year to be approximately 26%, excluding the impact of any discrete items. Also, deferred compensation plan investment results increased net gains from equity securities by $346 million and increased personnel expense by $349 million. As we've highlighted many times, while these hedges are largely P&L-neutral, they can result in large swings in our reported revenue and expense trends. In late May, we entered into arrangements to transition these economic hedges from equity securities to derivatives in the form of total return swaps.\nAs a result of this change, starting in the third quarter, our reporting for this item will be less volatile since most of the accounting impact from deferred comp hedges will be reported in personnel expense. Turning to Page 3. Charlie covered the support we're providing to our customers and communities during the pandemic, but let me just highlight that the approximately $400 million donation for small business recovery efforts we announced last week through the new Open For Business Fund will be donated when the gross fees are recognized in revenue. Turning to Page 4.\nWhile our earnings in the second quarter were significantly impacted by the economic environment, our capital and liquidity continued to be strong, with both our CET1 ratio and LCR increasing from the first quarter. Our CET1 ratio increased to 10.9% to 190 basis points, above our current regulatory minimum of 9%. We expect our stress capital buffer to be 2.5%, which is the lowest possible under the new framework, and would result in the regulatory minimum for our CET1 ratio remaining at 9%. Even with the large increases in our allowance over the past two quarters, our CET1 level was $23.7 billion above the regulatory minimum.\nOur LCR increased to 129%, 29 percentage points above our regulatory minimum, and our primary unencumbered sources of liquidity were approximately $511 billion. Turning to loans on Page 5. Similar to industry trends, period-end consumer and commercial loans outstanding declined in the second quarter, but average balances grew, reflecting increases in outstanding balances late in the first quarter. I'll explain the drivers of consumer and commercial period-end loan balances in more detail, starting with consumer on Page 6.\nConsumer loans were down $20.1 billion or 5% from the first quarter. This decline includes the reclassification of $10.4 billion of conforming first mortgage loans to held-for-sale status to provide flexibility to manage our balance sheet under the asset cap. The economic slowdown from COVID-19 reduced consumer spending and was reflected in lower credit card balances, lower auto originations, and other revolving and installment loan balances. In addition, we took actions during the second quarter to tighten credit standards given the current economic environment and to manage to the constraints of the asset cap.\nThese actions included no longer purchasing jumbo mortgage loans through our correspondent mortgage business and not accepting home equity and personal line of credit applications. In the auto business, we've taken actions to mitigate future loss exposure, and our spreads on new originations improved to their highest levels since 2016. That said, as states begin to reopen later in the quarter, we saw increased loan demand, including higher credit card spending and higher auto loan originations. Turning to commercial loans on Page 7.\nC&I loans declined $54.9 billion or 14% from the first quarter, driven by paydowns of revolving loans following increased loan draws in the first quarter during the market turbulence at the onset of the pandemic. As Charlie highlighted, almost all of the $80 billion of loan draws in March were paid down during the second quarter. These paydowns were partially driven by strength in capital markets and helped drive record revenues in the second quarter in our corporate and investment bank. Commercial real estate loans increased $2.1 billion from the first quarter, with growth in both commercial real estate mortgage and in construction loans.\nTurning to deposits on Page 8. The industry has experienced very strong growth, but due to our asset cap constraint, we've worked to manage growth of certain lower liquidity value deposit categories. However, even after these actions, average deposits grew 9% from a year ago and 4% from the first quarter. The linked-quarter growth was driven by noninterest-bearing deposits, which were up 18%, while interest-bearing deposits declined 1%.\nPeriod-end consumer and small business banking deposits grew $78.6 billion from the first quarter. This strong growth reflected COVID-19-related impacts, including customers' preference for liquidity; loan and tax payment deferrals, which otherwise would have reduced deposits; stimulus checks; and lower consumer spending. Wholesale Banking deposits declined $32.1 billion, reflecting actions we took to manage under the asset cap, including an emphasis on reducing certain nonoperational deposits. Average deposit cost declined to 17 basis points, down 35 basis points from the first quarter, with declines across all of our lines of business.\nWhile Wholesale Banking deposit costs declined the most, reflecting higher deposit betas, both WIM and Retail Banking deposit costs also declined. We currently have no active Retail Banking promotions, and we expect deposit costs will continue to decline in the second half of this year and reach the single-digit lows realized in 2015 and 2016. Net interest income declined $1.4 billion or 13% from the first quarter due to balance sheet repricing, driven by the impact of a lower interest rate environment; $275 million less favorable hedge ineffectiveness accounting results driven by large interest rate changes; $187 million of higher MBS premium amortization due to higher prepayment rates; and these declines were partially offset by a shift to a lower cost mix of funding. Net interest income was down 13% for the first half of the year.\nAnd as I discussed in June, we currently expect net interest income to be in the $41 billion to $42 billion range for the full-year 2020, which would be down 11% to 13% from the full year of 2019. This decline reflects the lower interest rate environment and the constraints the asset cap places on our ability to grow the size of our balance sheet, as well as higher MBS premium amortization, which we expect to persist for the remainder of the year. Turning to Page 10. Noninterest income increased $1.6 billion or 24% from the first quarter, driven by a $1.9 billion increase in net gains from equity securities, reflecting lower securities impairment and higher deferred compensation plan investment results.\nI'll explain some of these drivers in more detail. Deposit service charges were down $279 million from the first quarter, driven by COVID-19-related impacts, including lower overdrafts as customers have reduced debit card transactions and increased deposit balances, as well as higher fee waivers. Trust and investment fees declined $223 million from the first quarter. Investment banking had a strong quarter, with revenue increasing $156 million or 40%, driven by strength in debt and equity capital markets.\nThis growth was more than offset by both lower retail brokerage advisory fees, which were priced at the beginning of the second quarter when market levels for advisory assets where pricing were lower, and decline in brokerage transactional revenue. Mortgage banking revenue was relatively stable linked quarter, with strong growth in mortgage loan originations more than offset by declines in servicing income. Total residential held-for-sale originations increased 30% from the first quarter to $43 billion, primarily driven by lower mortgage interest rates. Lower interest rates drove strong industry volume, with second quarter estimated to be the largest origination market since the third quarter of 2003.\nAs we managed our application pipeline to handle the strong demand, our margins increased. In the second quarter, our production margin on residential held-for-sale mortgage loans was 204 basis points, up from 108 basis points in the first quarter. We've continued to add capacity and expect originations to increase in the third quarter if rates remain low, and we would expect margins to be relatively stable with second-quarter levels. Servicing revenue declined $960 million from the first quarter.\nThe decline was driven by a lower valuation of our MSR asset as a result of updated assumptions, including higher prepayment assumptions, and higher expected servicing costs due to an increase in projected defaults. Servicing fees were also lower due to payment deferrals and fee waivers provided to our customers in response to the pandemic. Finally, net gains from trading activities increased $743 million from higher trading volumes across many products, increased volatility leading to wider bid offer spreads, and substantial spread and price improvement in certain capital markets. Turning to expenses on Page 11.\nAs Charlie highlighted, our expenses are too high, and we're beginning to take further action to improve our efficiency. The $1.5 billion increase in our expenses from the first quarter was driven by higher operating losses, as well as higher personnel expense, reflecting a $947 million increase in deferred comp expense. Charlie described the $1.2 billion of operating losses, which included $765 million of customer remediation accruals for a variety of matters, as well as higher litigation accruals. The $597 million increase in personnel expense included the increase in deferred compensation, which is P&L neutral; and $231 million of COVID-19-related employee expenses, including premium pay for those who had to come into the office, and payments for backup child care.\nMost of the COVID-19-related employee expenses have now expired. We also had $133 million of higher COVID-19-related occupancy expense to make our properties safer for our employees and customers, including enhanced cleaning, additional supplies and workstation modifications. These costs will likely remain elevated until the pandemic ends. The impact of COVID-19 also reduced some of our expenses, including travel and entertainment and advertising and promotion expense.\nTurning to our business segments, starting on Page 12, as Charlie highlighted, we now have the leadership for our five business segments in place, and we will transition to reporting our segments in accordance with the structure starting in the third quarter. Community Banking reported a net loss of $331 million, driven by an increase in provision expense. On Page 13, we provide our Community Banking metrics. We had 31.1 million digital active customers, up 4% from a year ago.\nWhile the number of digital customers remain stable from the first quarter, these customers are doing more digitally, with log-ins up 10% from the first quarter, and the number of checks deposited using a mobile device reaching a record high in the second quarter, up 32% from the first quarter. Approximately 20% of our branches are temporarily closed due to COVID-19. As a result of fewer branches being opened and increased digital usage, teller and ATM transactions were down 19% from the first quarter and 28% from a year ago. However, we still have approximately 1 million teller transactions occurring at our branches every business day.\nOur customers' demand for cash has decreased by approximately 20% compared to a year ago. This decrease was reflected in lower demand for cash in our branches. While ATM transaction volume was down, the amount of cash withdrawn at our ATMs has increased, reflecting higher levels of cash per withdrawal, in part driven by the higher ATM withdrawal limits we implemented in the first quarter. Charlie highlighted the improving trends we experienced during the second quarter for debit and credit card spend.\nHigher debit card spend later in the quarter resulted in total second-quarter spend being flat compared with a year ago. However, transaction volume was down 13% from a year ago, with customers spending more per transaction. As a reminder, debit card fees are based on transaction volume, not dollar volume. Turning to Page 14.\nWholesale Banking reported a net loss of $2.1 billion as revenue growth was more than offset by an increase in provision for credit losses. I've already discussed the drivers of loans and deposits, so let me highlight a few other business drivers. Corporate and investment banking capital markets had record revenue in the second quarter, driven by the trading revenue increases I described earlier and record investment-grade debt issuance. Wells Fargo Capital Finance was the No.\n1 book runner of asset-based loans, with year-to-date market share increasing to 20%. We maintained our leadership position in this market by providing an important source of liquidity to our customers during a very challenging time. Wealth and Investment Management earned $180 million in the second quarter, down 61% from the first quarter, primarily driven by an increase in the allowance for credit losses, the lower interest rate environment and lower market valuations at the beginning of the quarter. We continue to experience strong demand from clients for liquidity products with growth in deposits and money market funds in our asset management business.\nWells Fargo asset management achieved a record high $578 billion in assets under management in the second quarter, up 12% from the first quarter, driven by continued momentum in the money market business, higher market valuations and fixed income net inflows. While advisory assets in our brokerage business increased 14% during the quarter, we had lower retail brokerage advisory fees since they're priced at the beginning of the quarter when market valuations were lower. These fees will benefit from the stronger markets at the beginning of the third quarter. Turning to credit results for the company on Page 16.\nOur net charge-off rate was up eight basis points from the first quarter to 46 basis points, which is still a historically low level, particularly during an extremely challenging economic environment. Keep in mind that a significant amount of customer accommodations we provided for our consumer and commercial customers since the start of the pandemic will delay the recognition of net charge-offs, delinquencies and nonaccrual status for those customers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status. However, I will point out that this dynamic was considered in our allowance for credit losses. Commercial criticized assets increased $13.3 billion or 53% from the first quarter, with C&I up $7.2 billion and CRE up $6.1 billion.\nNonaccrual loans increased $1.4 billion from the first quarter, driven by growth in commercial nonaccruals. I would note that 75% of our commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest principal as of the end of the second quarter. We provide more detail on C&I nonaccrual loans on Page 17. While C&I loans outstanding and total commitments declined from the first quarter, nonaccrual loans increased 59%, driven by oil and gas and real estate and construction C&I loans, which includes credit facilities to REITs and other non-depository financial institutions.\nLast quarter, we provided more details on industries with escalated monitoring, and those industries largely drove the increase in criticized assets in the second quarter, including retail, entertainment, and recreation. Turning to our commercial real estate portfolio on Slide 18. We are the nation's largest commercial real estate lender, and our portfolio is well diversified, both by property type and geography. Our commercial real estate loans are subjected to rigorous underwriting standards and are well structured.\nBefore COVID-19, this portfolio was performing at historically strong credit levels with a good mix of assets and geography, a well-capitalized customer base and overall low levels of leverage. We have proactively reduced our exposure to retail and have minimal exposure to land or condos where losses were highest in the last cycle. Since the pandemic began, we've worked to assist customers on a case-by-case basis. We've continued our strict routine monitoring process with the goal of identifying problems early.\nOur CRE team has an experienced bench with workout backgrounds and perspective in times of distress, which has enabled us to ramp up quickly. However, these are unprecedented times, and nonaccruals were up $286 million or 30% from the first quarter. Given what's been going on in the economy, it's not surprising that shopping centers, retail and hotels, motels, accounted for 59% of nonaccrual loans in the second quarter and accounted for 90% of the increase from the first quarter. Criticized assets were up $6.1 billion or 140% from the first quarter, driven by the same sectors that drove the increase in nonaccruals, with the addition of office buildings.\nTurning to our oil and gas portfolio on Page 19. Oil and gas loans accounted for 1% of our total loans outstanding, with $12.6 billion outstanding at the end of the quarter down 12% from the first quarter. Total commitments were down $1.7 billion from the first quarter, reflecting the impact of spring redetermination changes on borrowing basis, proactive portfolio management, as well as the weaker credit environment. Net charge-offs increased $111 million from the first quarter, with 87% of second-quarter net charge-offs from the E&P sector.\nNonaccrual loans increased $865 million from the first quarter, with approximately 93% of nonaccruals still current on payments. Criticized loans increased 26% from the first quarter, reflecting downward credit migration resulting from commodity price volatility and included numerous credit downgrades of publicly rated companies. On Page 20, we provide detail on our allowance for credit losses. The $8.4 billion increase included $6.4 billion for commercial loans and $2 billion for consumer loans.\nOur allowance coverage for total loans was 2.19%, up 100 basis points from the end of the first quarter, with the largest increases across commercial loans, junior lien mortgage loans and credit card loans. We highlight the key drivers of the increase in our allowance for credit losses on Page 21. We considered current economic conditions, which worsened significantly compared to prior expectations as unemployment levels reached 14.7% in the second quarter. In addition, over $2.4 trillion in fiscal stimulus programs, as well as customer accommodations provided near-term support for borrowers.\nOn this page, we provide details on the economic forecast in our base case scenario for the second-quarter allowance, which assumes near-term economic stress recovering into late 2021, including unemployment levels declining to approximately 6% by the fourth quarter of 2021. While housing prices are forecasted to remain relatively stable, commercial real estate prices are forecasted to decline by low to mid-teens with hotel, restaurant and retail sectors expected to decline much further. In addition, collateral prices remain highly uncertain given limited property sales. While the large majority of weight is placed on the base case scenario, we apply some weighting to a downside scenario to reflect the uncertainty in the economic forecast.\nAnd as I previously mentioned, customer forbearance and other deferral activities provided in response to COVID-19 were considered in our loan portfolio performance expectations and loss forecast. However, please keep in mind that our allowance for credit losses is influenced by a variety of factors, including changes in loan volumes, portfolio credit quality, as well as general economic conditions. While the timing of the end of the pandemic and the eventual path to economic recovery remain unclear, we believe that our allowance captures the expected loss content in our portfolio as of the end of the second quarter. Turning to capital on Page 22.\nAs I highlighted earlier, our CET1 ratio increased to 10.9% in the second quarter. We elected to apply the modified CECL transition provision to our regulatory capital. The impact of this selection was an increase in capital of $1.9 billion and a 14-basis point increase in our CET1 ratio. Additionally, as a result of senior debt issuance during the second quarter and a decline in our RWA, our TLAC ratio increased to 25.3%, which provides a significant buffer to our required minimum of 22%.\nIn summary, our results in the second quarter were disappointing, and economic conditions remain uncertain. But we're focused on doing the work necessary to improve the earnings capacity of the company, including reducing our expenses while meeting our regulatory commitments. And Charlie and I will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nYes. Good morning. My first question is a clarification question for Charlie. Charlie, during your prepared remarks, you noted that your expenses were about $10 billion greater than your peers or where you need to be to be equivalent to peers on efficiency.\nAre you saying that mopping off $10 billion in expenses is an eventual long-term goal for this company to be in line with your larger peers?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I mean, what I said was that the math -- if you do the math, what it says is that when you look at their efficiency ratios versus ours, our expenses are at least $10 billion higher than they should be, and there's no reason why that should occur. And so we are doing the work to create a road map for a company which is significantly more efficient. Exactly what the time frame is and where we ultimately get to, I think we'll provide more information on, and the future will play itself out. But we can do the same math that you can do, and there's no reason why, as a management team, we don't have the ability to be as efficient as the rest.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. That's clear. And my follow-up question has to do with the potential for the Fed to extend the income test beyond the third-quarter dividend. And I'm wondering, so as we think about -- you mentioned that expenses should start coming down in 2021.\nAs I think about how consensus is formulating future earnings power, I think consensus is expecting the majority of your reserve build should be behind you. But I don't think that restructuring costs, for example, that would relate to future efficiency initiatives are in with consensus. And I guess the question that I'm really asking here is that if the Fed extends the income test beyond the third quarter, do you feel confident that, according to how they're looking at dividend capacity, that $0.10 is supportable going forward?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. This is John. They certainly have the ability to extend the current framework. And frankly, it even seems likely just given the way the calendar lines up and the resubmission process is going to work for the next CCAR.\nI think Charlie's point is we're going to do what's necessary to get as efficient as we can be. And to the extent that that kicks off onetime charges, which you might expect, and if that has an influence on our dividend capacity as a result of the Fed keeping the current regime in place, then we'll have to tolerate that. I don't think we're not going to do what's right economically because of accounting consequences. We're going to follow GAAP.\nWe're going to get as efficient as we can. The outcome is going to be the outcome. In part, we set the current dividend or proposed to set the current dividend where it is so that it would buy us plenty of room to operate while we get through the next few quarters and chart the eventual path to greater profitability. But accounting consequences will be what they are.\nIt wasn't a primary consideration in setting a number where we did.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThe only thing that I would add is that when we think of the work that we did, our board didn't approach this conversation around the dividend with an idea of looking at it each quarter and making a determination. And so our hope is that this does become a level which is sustainable as we go through this period of uncertainty and as the Fed decides how they want to treat capital return over the next series of quarters. We do have some items that impact our capital -- our ability to return capital with this rule that doesn't reflect our earnings power going forward, right? We had a $3 billion settlement with the Department of Justice, which is, in our historical numbers, that $3 billion, when you look at it, is something like, round numbers, $0.18 a share of a negative that ultimately will roll out and is already actually in our capital numbers. So we have these dynamics that the board thought about when we set the dividend level for the quarter that don't relate to the future earnings capacity of the company even as we look out into 2021.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you for the clear answers.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nYes. Hi. Good morning. John, could you remind us just where you are on the asset cap flexibility? What needs to be done each quarter now with deposits coming in and some loan demand and what kind of flexibility you have to operate under that and where you are today on the way it gets measured? Thanks.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. Sure. So we were in compliance with it at the end of the second quarter. And the items that we did during the late first and early second quarter to maintain compliance were really focused on our wholesale funding footprint by shrinking the amount of external repo and other financing that we do and taking trading assets down.\nAnd then we had a focus on certain categories of nonoperational deposits, the ones that have very low liquidity value. And it's really -- from this point forward, this is more of a liability management exercise to make sure that we don't retain too much in the way of low liquidity value deposits, that we're thoughtful about other liabilities. On the asset side, there's so much cash on the balance sheet right now that it gives plenty of flexibility, I think, to do what we need to do with loans. You saw that our LCR print is 129% for the quarter, and deposits have grown nicely.\nSo we're very thoughtful and cautious about how we price deposits, about those that have low liquidity value. We're thoughtful about maturities as they come up in non-deposit funding because with the inflow of deposits, we can rely more on that and less on notes and institutional CDs and other things. That's the work that we've been doing, and that's the path that we have for the next quarter or two.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And you reiterated the net interest income outlook for the year. How should we think about kind of the jumping-off point for the net interest margin and net interest income as we go into next quarter? What are some of the puts and takes that we should factor into the model?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I think it's going to be relatively flat from where it is today. We're in that zone. And as I said, $41 billion to $42 billion for the year still feels like the right number.\nSo I think it'll be -- we're not really carefully managing the NIM. We're looking for the dollars in net interest income, but it shouldn't deviate too much from where we are right now.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. And is there anything in terms of asset cap progress, Charlie, you can comment on? I know you can't say too much but in terms of the work being done and progress and doing what you need to do to satisfy the Fed.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nJohn, I appreciate everyone being interested given the limitations of it and asking the question. It's going to be the same response every single quarter, which is we're focused on it. It is, along with the other enforcement actions, the biggest priority that we have. We're doing our work, and the Fed will determine when the work is done to their satisfaction.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Scott.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nGood morning. Hey, thanks for taking. John, just was hoping you might be able to sort of update or refresh your thoughts on how and sort of when losses might evolve. I guess embedded in that is sort of how are you treating reups deferral requests, things like that.\nAnd I guess additionally, the updated reserve build kind of implies sort of what you're thinking about cumulative losses through the period, but just any updated thoughts you can share, please.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Well, as it relates to deferrals, which generally speaking, is the consumer side of the house, the fact that we are deferring definitely pushes out roles through delinquency buckets into charge-off, and so the actual charge-offs themselves will probably come later than they otherwise would. We believe that we've fully provided or captured that in the allowance. And so we've taken the credit charge today that we think is the right one at the end of the quarter, even if the charge-offs come somewhat later.\nWe're also seeing -- we saw a tick-up in charge-offs in commercial, but there also, things do take a little bit before they roll. I guess I would expect the charge-off rates, and it will be different by asset category, to sort of move up slowly through the end of the year, even into the first couple of quarters of next year and then start to flatten out after that, just based on the way things progress through loss recognition.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK. Perfect. And then maybe just to switch gears a little, the additional customer remediation accruals. Charlie or John, can you go through sort of the -- I know you alluded to sort of taking a fresh look at things under new management.\nBut I guess just curious, given the charges we've already seen over the past couple of years, sort of what drove those additional accruals and the new thinking.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. As Charlie said, it's new leadership at the top of the organization in Consumer Lending and in the center capability that we have running customer remediation. I think they've gone item by item and thought about how to be a little bit more expansive, a little bit more consumer friendly. Many of these things aren't crystal clear, and you're always making a judgment as to who it applies to, how much should apply, and over what time frame.\nAnd really in an effort, as Charlie said, to speed it up and move it through, they were a little bit more expansive in order to accomplish that. But by and large, it's the same items that we've been talking about for the last couple of years. There are always new things that come in and out of that bucket, but the bigger dollars relate to the same topics that we've been covering for a while.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd the only thing I'd emphasize, as John said, is most of the dollars do relate to those items. And there's a lot of value in getting these things behind us. It's the work. It's the overhang.\nIt's what our customers and communities think about us. And so we're obviously going to do what's right for the financial position of the company. But we want to treat people properly, and we want to move on and move to the future. And so we made decisions around what we were willing to do, certainly with that balanced lens.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK. Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Hey, a couple of questions. So first off, Charlie, just want to get a sense as to where we should be thinking about where the expense improvements come from.\nAnd the reason I'm asking is, I know you're in the middle of the business unit reviews. You've got new business unit heads in several places. Typically, folks like that are going to want to make investments. You're not going to touch the regulatory side.\nSo where should we anticipate you have room to start bringing down expenses ahead of regulatory framework changes?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. And I think your point is actually a very important one, which is part of the reason why we're trying to be very careful about making it clear that we are going forward and actively going to start to take actions to reduce expenses. But we don't want to back ourselves into a corner until all of our work is done because of those two things that you mentioned, which are very important. Having said that, the reality is that the work that we have to do.\nThe foundational work to build the risk and strong infrastructure and ultimately satisfy the work that the regulators would like us to satisfy, it's clear. It's distinct. It is fairly broad across the company, but we know exactly what it is and what resources are decked against that. When we look elsewhere in the company, and I think I used the words in the prepared remarks, it is -- we have spans and layers at the company which are well beyond what I've seen at other places and makes us a very, very inefficient company.\nWhen we just look at the work that's being generated, the things that are being done, we, as a management team, believe that we can change the priorities so that we're being really clear on what has to get done and stop a bunch of work that has to get done. We have duplicative platforms, duplicative processes across the company. And so as we think about a series of these things, they are extremely significant because these things exist just about in every part of the company. In addition, I just also want to point out that we have stopped any reductions that were going to take place, just given the environment.\nAnd so there is a series of actions that we are ready to take. In fact, we have a series of employees who've been told that their jobs will ultimately go away, but we're going to let some time pass as we got through the initial stages of the COVID crisis. So we do see a clear path to start making an impact on the expense base. And it's like an onion.\nThe more we do, the more clearer the next round will become.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nAnd is that something that you could start in the second half? I know you mentioned that we'd see the benefits here in 2021 with expenses below '20. But should we anticipate that some of this will start in second-half '20?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWe are clearly going to take the actions in the second half of this year. And obviously, depending on what the economics of all that is and the accounting of it, not quite sure whether you'll see it in next year.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. Yes. OK. That's understandable.\nAnd then could I just switch gears to a question on mortgage? So the question here -- yes.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI just want to add one thing, which I just think is important, which is because I didn't say this in the prepared remarks. But I've certainly talked about this inside the company, which is we don't look at a quarter like this and just say, OK, that is what it is. Losses are higher. Our margins are narrow.\nWe know we've got some work going on, and so we'll eventually get around to it. While we knew these things had to get done and the work was getting done, it's not lost on us, our underperformance relative to where we should be earning. And so while I think there was a sense of urgency toward both getting the regulatory work done and improving our performance, whatever sense of urgency existed before is going to be small relative to what it is going forward.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes. Yes, I got that. No, I get that. And I also am hearing in your commentary that the costs around the regulatory and the risk in those costs.\nIs it fair to say they're more known today than they were maybe a year ago?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I think absolutely. As time goes on and we get clear on what has to be done, it's clearly easier for us to put a broad understanding of what that takes. And again, just to be clear, when we go -- and part of the reason why it takes us a period of time to do this properly is we're going to have very formal processes in place to ensure whatever reductions in our expense base we take that they do not impact any of that work.\nAnd so that will be informal, and it will be very, very formal because that would be just a terrible, terrible mistake for everyone if we were not to do that properly. So beyond heightened consciousness on that issue.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. All right. Just switching to mortgage. Refi speeds have been incredibly high through second quarter.\nAnd John, I just wanted to get your sense as to what's in your base case assumptions for 3Q, 4Q? I mean, part of the reason for asking is it impacts the servicing prepayment speed that impacts your NII outlook with refinancing on the agency. And then I also just wanted to have a quick follow-up question here on the Ginnie buyouts that you did that the American Banker highlighted this morning. Just understand, is that the first of many or not? Thanks.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Good question. So on mortgage fees, and it shows up in the MSR, shows up in our investment portfolio, and it shows up in the runoff of booked loans that are in our held-for-investment portfolio in loan form. The speed assumptions vary, depending on the vintage, the coupon, the debt-to-income, the LTV, etc., and the refinance ability of borrower by borrower.\nBut I think we're as aware as anyone of how fast things have gotten. And we're seeing 30-handle CPR on various pools of loans. And so while we think we've captured that in our updated estimates on the MSR, in particular, it does feed into this level of, call it, $500 million to $700 million per quarter of premium amortization for mortgage securities, which, as I said, is likely to remain for the rest of the year. On Ginnie buyouts, what's happening there is that there are loans that have gone delinquent in part because of COVID.\nAnd as the servicer, we essentially have the accounting consequence of owning them, whether we buy them out or not. Because the option to purchase them is so deeply in the money, we're deemed to have bought them. And so our calculus was either to have a giant pile of cash and that consolidated asset or to go ahead and buy them out and not have that asset -- essentially that asset twice but use the cash to buy the asset. And these are guaranteed loans, from our perspective, not a huge credit consequence.\nIt's just carrying the asset for a period of time before it either gets redelivered or sold or worked out in some way. So that's why we were a big buyer in the -- actually, that was after the end of the quarter. And then with respect to whether it continues on, well, it's facts and circumstances. The same tension will apply.\nIf we're deemed to have them on our books because we have the option to buy them, then we may -- and if cash levels remain where they are, then we may go ahead and do it, just so that we don't really double up the size of our balance sheet. And that is an asset cap consideration.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes. No, that makes a ton of sense. But so it's a function of more forbearance from here. Is that the driver?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. More/ongoing. That's right. And whether we're the servicer or not, but that's right.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes, that's right. OK. Thanks, John.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, Ken.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Good afternoon now at East Coast. Just a follow-up question on the NII outlook.\nIt seems like in the second half, some pluses or minuses just to get to the mid-zone of your 41, 42. But just can you help us understand just how much more roll-through there needs to be from here on both asset yields and securities deals to your earlier points of how you're reinvesting? And then what from here can also happen on the deposit cost side as a partial offset?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So I think on the deposit cost side, our anticipation is that between the reduction in pricing for interest-bearing deposits and the growth or continuity of noninterest-bearing deposits that our average deposit cost is back in the single-digit basis points by the third or fourth quarter. That's the trajectory that we're on. That's where we were in 2015, 2016.\nOn the asset side, depending on what happens to LIBOR, probably, in particular, the spreads are holding firm where we're lending. And there will be some -- it could be some lower-spread loan product that is replaced with higher. You've heard about that in autos. It's true in some categories of C&I.\nBut that's a piece of it. On the securities front, we've been trying to stay invested, but the level of prepayments that Betsy just referred to, I think, at our securities portfolio, down by almost $30 million in the quarter. And so how much more duration we want to add at these low yields is a separate issue. We haven't been adding much in credit-related securities product.\nBut as I mentioned, I think, to John, the outlook for NIM is relatively range-bound through the rest of the year. And we're sort of bumping along what we think the bottom could be. I mean, obviously, things could change. But at zero in the front end and 60, 70 basis points in the long end, this feels about like where we're likely to be with the things that I mentioned.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nRight. And then so I guess then it really just NII growth next year or just -- you're starting from a high point this year, so will probably be in the hold still next year. But really, does it depend on the asset cap then? Or does it depend on the mix of earning assets in order to get that kind of off this $10 billion-ish type of NII number?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. It's a good question. It's both. So it's what choices we make on the asset side and what the market is offering.\nWhere loan demand comes from, I think, will matter a lot, slope of the curve. If things get a little steeper, that obviously could be helpful because we're so exposed at the long end. And then if there's an opportunity to have a bigger balance sheet, we're certainly not budgeting that way or counting on it, but that would be a difference maker.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. One just quick follow-up, John. On the servicing side of mortgage, great production and then the tougher servicing results. There's both the core fees that are contracting because of the prepays, and then there's all the hedging.\nWhat's the best way you can help us understand how that mortgage banking line item just projects from here given especially the uncertainty in how you model out the servicing side?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. It's tricky. So I think what we've said is we expect volumes on the production side to be a little bit higher and margins to be relatively constant. So if those two things hold true, the third quarter should be a relatively great production environment for mortgage.\nAnd on the servicing side, we think we've captured the higher servicing costs for default servicing, modification servicing, etc. We now have faster speed expectations in the model. Although we said that a quarter ago, too, we were surprised on the downside. But if both of those things are captured, then we will produce lower servicing fees because the book itself is getting smaller.\nBut I'll take smaller servicing revenue as long as we're not taking big writedowns on the assets that are offsetting the benefit that we're generating on the origination side, and hopefully, the third quarter reflects that.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. Thanks, John.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nHi, Saul.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi, guys. Hello. Thanks for taking my questions. First of all, a really, really specific question related to the fourth-quarter dividend cap.\nCan you just verify, John, that that's based on net income before preferred stock dividends? Because I think that the guidance from the Fed is public that it's based on your NIAT net income figure. And for you guys, obviously, that does matter given the size of the preferred stock dividend. So I just wanted to make sure that that point is clarified.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. The way we're calculating its NIAT after tax but before preferred stock dividends, which gets you to NIAT available to common.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. OK. So you're calculating before preferred stock dividends.\nJust to be clear.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nCorrect. Yes.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. A much, much, much broader question. And kudos on the donation to CDFIs.\nI think a lot of them do a lot of very good work. And I guess on that point, though, I do think that it's pretty clear, though, that Wells does have to, maybe more than others, really focus on multiple stakeholders and different goals. And the idea of strictly shareholder-driven capital is obviously already under tapped. And you have to meet your regulators, meet their demands, employees.\nI think you guys genuinely are concerned about the well-being of the communities you work in. And then you have guys like me who talk about your ROTCEs and super high-efficiency ratios and how you're going to rightsize your cost structures. And I guess how do you think about that, the balancing act and of those competing demands? I think in the past, those management teams have argued that they can do all of those things simultaneously. And I think to a certain degree, maybe that is true, but there are some trade-offs and some element of the zero-sum dynamic going on.\nSo I guess, Charlie, I'm curious maybe just more philosophically how you kind of think about that. And I guess ultimately, how do you think about shareholder value in that total pool of goals?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I guess I don't think about it as a trade-off, and I don't think about it as something which is different for us versus other significant companies, whether you're a financial institution or not. I think it is very, very clear that our ability to be successful as a company for our shareholders includes the fact that we are broadly considering a much broader set of stakeholders. If we don't do that, customers, whether they're consumers or companies, ultimately won't want to be supportive of us.\nWe'll have issues in our local communities. It will filter through to the legislative and likely the regulatory agenda. So I think we very much think that they are very much related and that there's no reason why the things that we should be doing to be more thoughtful of a broader set of stakeholders. They aren't a set of financial negatives.\nUltimately, it should be something beyond that. The PPP fees were certainly something that was very unique. We are in the middle of this really horrific time for small businesses and especially minority-owned small businesses. The right thing for us as a significant company in this country is to be as helpful as we can with that community.\nIt's also ultimately helpful for us if we can make a difference in the communities that we operate. And then we also looked at that relative to just what we thought was fair for us in order to participate in the PPP program. And so I think you put all those things together, and there is alignment. And those that don't think about it that way will likely suffer over the long term.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nAll right. Thanks for the thoughtful answer. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good afternoon. So I wanted to start off, Charlie, with just a theoretical question on the asset cap. Can you talk about the proactive steps that we're taking to manage the balance sheet to stay below? How that's negatively impacted NII? Since most investors are focusing at this juncture on normalized NII and through-the-cycle revenue growth expectations.\nIf the Fed were to lift the asset cap tomorrow, I was hoping you can give us some idea or context around the amount of pent-up growth potential in the balance sheet today. I think it would be helpful if you could frame the impact of the asset cap on NII or at least volume growth based on where things stand today.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nSo this is John. Just as a data point using rough math, if our balance sheet was expanded by, call it, $200 billion or about 10% during this COVID time frame and is a question about whether there was ample opportunity to do that around several asset classes. But in certain areas, there certainly was, with something like our average NIM, the impact that that would have had on us would have been -- and these are approximations, but to reduce the drawdown on NII by 50%. So half of how things have worsened would have been covered by that expansion of the balance sheet.\nThat's one way to think about it. There were more immediate opportunities to put loans on, in particular, I'd say, in March, as capital markets were closed. I think everybody knows that. And we saw customers drawing on available facilities, new other requests for new facilities.\nThe bigger, probably more constant piece of an increased balance sheet, at least in the businesses that we serve today, would probably be to have a bigger securities and securities financing portfolio in support of our corporate and investment bank, where we have drawn down as part of managing under the asset cap. And there's a handful of benefits to that, including being able to do more business with the companies that we're -- and the institutions that we're financing in that realm. But you also end up with a big LIBOR-funded book that is a little bit less asymmetric in a down rate scenario, and we certainly suffered from that. There's a real benefit to being substantially deposit funded in that it's very low cost to begin with.\nBut in a down rate environment, it's a little bit more violent in terms of the outcome that it generates. And to have a bigger component piece of LIBOR-funded assets with LIBOR-funded liabilities, it's a little bit less high producing in the best of times, but it maintains its margin in a down rate environment. So that would have been a benefit also. But Charlie, you may have other thoughts.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think that's OK.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nOK. No, that's helpful color, John. I have one more question. It's one, I guess, I've asked over the last couple of quarters.\nBut wanted to get some context around the core fee income level or the jumping-off point we should think about for the back half. You cited some of the tailwinds from mortgage production. Trust fees should benefit from the higher markets. But you also have some normalization of trading activity.\nAnd just given all the different moving pieces, I was hoping you can give us some sense as to what the right jumping-off point might be for 3Q.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. We don't put a number on it and call it core but rather talk about the component pieces of it. And so service charges on deposits, which is a big one for us, my assumption is that it's going to feel, at least for a while, like it does today. People are spending differently.\nThey're maintaining cash balances at a higher level. And so whether it's waivers because of high balances or the absence of overdraft, that puts pressure on that line item as our customers do what's right for them in this environment. You mentioned brokerage advisory, etc. That should be stronger going into the second half of the year.\nInvestment banking, we had a record high-grade market in the first quarter. So while other activity may pick up a little bit, my sense is that that probably normalizes somewhat. Card fees have reflected what I mentioned in my prepared remarks, which is at least in the debit card space, we've got balances or flows in dollar terms about equal to last year but the number of transactions lower, which has a negative impact in card fees. And credit card fees have been improving but haven't caught up.\nSo I don't think it's going to pop back up anytime really quickly. Mortgage, I mentioned on the production side, should be very strong or should be strong. And hopefully, we've accounted for faster speeds and higher costs in servicing. Trading, as you said, probably gets a little bit softer.\nAnd other items are less material, and there's nothing really noteworthy. So that's how I would think about the categories.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nYou covered it well. Thanks so much for that, John.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYou bet. Sure.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nHi, Matt.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nHi. I wanted to circle back on kind of the longer-term view of getting your efficiency closer to peers. And I guess the first question is why do you necessarily think it's an expense issue versus a revenue issue. Or is it a combination of both?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nIt's definitely a combination of both. Revenue, particularly interest income, which doesn't carry a lot of expense load, would be very helpful. I think what we're trying to do is assess where the company is today and what we can do about it. And we can do more about expense than we can about revenue in a balance sheet-constrained environment, in a recession and in a low rate environment.\nSo it's actionable by the management team. But without a doubt, some amount of normalization of certain categories of revenue will contribute to it. But having said that, I think we've sort of factored in a variety of different ways on the idea that all things being equal, and I'm sure they won't be, but at least as we think about it today, that $10 billion is a reasonable amount to go after to put Wells Fargo on a level playing field with the large-cap peers.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd the only thing I would add to what John said is this isn't -- the calculation of the $10 billion, that's a mathematical exercise. When the management team, the operating committee gets in a room, there is absolutely no disagreement in the room, not about the math, but about the inefficiencies that exist inside the company away from all of these risk-related activities. And the work that we've been doing is to build the plans from the bottom-up to identify where that is. And so whether that's the full $10 billion or not, we'll see what we get to.\nBut we certainly have a clear belief that we can make a significant dent based upon what we know.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nAnd just to be clear what you think kind of the longer-term cost base can be, when you used the $10 billion as kind of a reference point, should we just annualize this quarter's costs? That gets you about $58 billion. You take out $10 billion, gets you around $48 billion? I mean, is that the thought process?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nI think of 54-ish as more of the normalized starting point without the excess expenses that are loaded into this quarter for the items that we mentioned.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. $10 billion of the $54 billion?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. And I guess just related to that, like, whenever I think about kind of cost saves, like there are areas that you'll want to invest in. There is just natural inflation creep. So you guys kind of opened up a little bit of a can of worms on the $10 billion.\nSo I know these are things that are tough to predict, like looking out a few years.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nBut we didn't open a can of worms because -- I don't look at it like we opened a can of worms. I think we look at it like we're acknowledging what the facts are, which is -- the facts are is we compete with other companies that are investing tremendously. And with those set of investments, the math says the following. And so what we've been purposely having said, we're going to reduce our expenses by a certain point in time because we are doing the work to figure out what the timing looks like with our reductions versus our investments.\nBut I think what's important is not just that we acknowledge that that gap exists, but we are proactively working to get to a place which makes sense both from an efficiency standpoint, knowing that we should be investing in the business.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. All right. And it sounds like we'll get some more details in the third quarter or so. I think we all look forward to that.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Matt.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nHi, John.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOn the credit side, just want to see if I can get your updated thoughts around your through-cycle loss estimates that you would expect. I know your 2020 company run DFAST is about $27.7 billion. Is that a fair way to think about it? And then also, I want to get your thoughts around the reserve. You took a pretty good addition this quarter, and now your reserve is about 74% of that 2020 DFAST.\nDo you think there's likelihood for additional substantial reserve additions from here? Thanks.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks for the question. So we do the math to compare our own estimations to the DFAST outcomes, but we don't think of them as necessarily better informed about our loans and our portfolios and our risk profile and our collection activity, etc. So it's a useful data point, and it's an external one that people can judge against. But we think more about our own experience and the scenarios that we believe are the likely ones in the world that we're living in.\nAnd so that's how we focused it. With the build that we made in the allowance, I think we're at almost 2.2% coverage of the outstanding loan portfolio. And of course, it's very different by loan category like it is for every other bank. I think we believe that if the world unfolds in the way that we've got it modeled and assumed in our both modeled loss estimations and in our bottoms-up portfolio-by-portfolio work that we will have captured the loss content in the portfolio as of the end of the quarter.\nAnd as a result, unless things really lag in a worse direction, that this would have accounted for those losses.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks, John. And then related to that, on the commercial real estate side, just wanted to see if you could discuss the credit trends that you're seeing in commercial real estate. I know that delinquencies in CMBS structures really spiked for the industry beyond even financial crisis levels.\nBut clearly, that is being staved off somewhat at the banks by forbearance efforts. Can you just give us a little bit of that granularity around what you're seeing and the level of forbearance in commercial real estate? And is it seeing a greater pressure in the portfolio to forbear given the pressure that your borrowers are seeing? Thanks.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Yes. The first distinguishing point I would make is that -- and I know you know this, but for everybody's benefit, CMBS structures are nonrecourse loans, and so there's no alternative other than realizing on the collateral. There's no mechanism for extra cash flow to enter into a structure unless somebody does something that are not contractually obligated to do to try and shore things up.\nAnd I think as I've seen most recently, the June numbers in CMBS are about 13% of loans are not current. Conversely, on a bank's balance sheet, most of the loans that we have, have real sponsorship and recourse and, generally speaking, are lower LTV than CMBS to begin with. So our actual performance is quite different. And then I think we talked about this last quarter, too, but the variation in how deep will go from an LTV perspective is, as you'd hope, with the more stable property types, we might have higher leverage, and with the least stable property types, we'd have lower leverage, which helps a lot in a downdraft.\nSo we have, in round numbers, roughly $150 billion worth of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the quarter. The biggest pieces: a quarter of that is office; 20% of that is apartments; 12% is industrial; 10% is retail, excluding shopping centers; and then 9% is shopping centers; and everything else is below 9%. Actually, hotels is about 8%, which is a volatile property type. And then among nonaccrual loans, the shopping centers are 32%; hotels, 14%; and retail, excluding shopping centers, is another 14%; and everything else is below 14%.\nThere's about $1.3 billion of nonaccruals overall. So that's what it feels like. We're working through these things borrower by borrower. Sometimes, the concessions that we're making are just covenant-related.\nSometimes, they are real forbearance. And we allow people to take a little bit more time to pay. Our borrowers have been generally calm and constructive. It's not a lot of panic at this point in the cycle.\nThe problem loans are skewed toward retail projects, many of which were already struggling, and then also the hotel owners with lower capitalization. So I hope that's helpful.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. No, that is helpful. So really, you're reserving within commercial real estate. Or you would say that that represents the similar stance for your overall portfolio? In other words, you're pretty much finished building reserves there as well?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nFor how we understand the world at the end of the second quarter, yes. And we think that's relatively -- we think it's very realistic. I should also add that in commercial real estate and elsewhere, our teams have gone loan by loan, borrower by borrower and made an assessment of where we think we are and where we think things are going. So it's not just a model set of expectations but a real careful review of every borrower, every property in their circumstances.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. All right. Thanks, John.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Brian.\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks, guys. One quick question that's more of a clarification. You did mention that on Slide 16 that say that nonaccruals were current on interest and principal.\nWas that referring to the $1.4 billion increase? Or was that referring to the total? And I guess why nonaccrual if they're current on interest and principal?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nTotal, the total amount.\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nOK. And then separately, when you think about the DFAST results, and you're saying that you may perform better than those results, I guess, where do you take exception with kind of how the Fed is modeling your stress losses versus how you see them coming through this cycle?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Forgive me if I don't start a response by saying we take exception with the Fed's results in the following way because that's not really that will be helpful. But they draw from different models and have different approaches. And we draw from our own, as I said, bottoms-up, our own modeled outcomes, our own historical outcomes, changing the composition of the portfolio or changing the underwriting standards and whatever we're comparing it to.\nAnd we end up with the numbers that we end up with. I'm happy to note that I think, in general, the Fed applies, in general, a lower loss rate for a variety of loan categories to Wells Fargo than they have for some other lenders not universally true based on the composition of portfolios. But we like our numbers where a lot of work with a lot of very close inside knowledge of borrowers, properties, etc., goes into it, and it's being compared with something that's more statistically driven from a model that we don't have access to.\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Company.\nChris Kotowski -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nYes. Good morning. Two things. One, just to follow up on Matt's question, I mean, just from 2017 to today, I mean, your revenue runway went from $88 billion to roughly $70-ish billion.\nAnd your core operating expenses have kind of stayed flattish at $54-ish billion, let's say it. So I mean, sitting here on the outside, it would look like it's primarily a revenue problem, not an expense problem. And I mean, when you put out a number like $10 billion, are you worried that that is going to like forego the optionality on capturing back that $18 billion in lost revenues? Or should we assume that that's kind of gone?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I think you should go back and listen to the words that we used to describe what the $10 billion is and how we're thinking about this. Listen, there's no question in our minds that we should have the ability to generate higher revenues in the future. No question that will help when it comes to an efficiency ratio.\nWhat we're talking about is, if you go back and look at where we were as a company versus the others, the others, the big companies that we compete with have been working on this for five to 10 years. And again, we're being very factual about it, which you should go back and check yourself, which is there is this meaningful difference between what our expense base looks like and theirs. And then I recognize you're on the outside, but what we're telling you is from one on the inside, that we, as a management team, continue to believe that the opportunities are substantial to improve the efficiency of the organization because we see it day in and day out. And we're going through a process to identify exactly what it is, where it is.\nIt's not just people. It's the third-party spend here is extraordinary. The things that we rely on outside people to do is beyond anything that I've ever seen. Our ability to reduce facilities is substantial.\nAnd so there's this long list of things that we will actively be working on. Whether that gets to $10 billion, whether it gets to more, whether it gets to less, we'll see. We're going to share more as we develop the plans. But I think it's just important for us as a management team to be very objective at what things look like for this company before we wound up in today's environment.\nAnd those efficiencies clearly exist in the company.\nChris Kotowski -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nOK. And then just a small thing. I thought I heard John say that you're no longer accepting home equity and personal line of credit applications. And I mean, I realize that those have been declining categories and that they are not the kind of product lines that today that they were before the great financial crisis and all that.\nBut still, are those kind of sort of key products in a big consumer bank's arsenal? And doesn't it send the wrong message to not even take the applications?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I guess I'll talk about my piece. John can talk about his. Because I guess the way I think about it is, first of all, we do offer personal lines in the company because we have a credit card business. And so for us, it's a question of making sure that we've got the right product in front of the customer.\nAnd so we think we have the ability to do that. The home equity product, as you rightfully mentioned, has certainly declined in terms of the amount of production that was taking place. But we do have to make a determination in the uncertain environment as to what is a smart thing for us to participate in along with consumers as they add risk to their balance sheet. As time goes on, if we feel differently about the environment and about real estate values, those decisions could change as well.\nChris Kotowski -- Oppenheimer and Company -- Analyst\nOK. Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP\u00a0Morgan.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nHi, Charlie. Hi, John. A couple of questions. Firstly, Charlie, are you still on track to be giving us some kind of strategic review or strategic plan toward the end of the year? Or should we expect that with the cost details that you're going to give us in the third quarter? How are you thinking in terms of timing of the two things?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think between the third and fourth quarter, we're looking at getting both done to share our complete set of thoughts with you.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. So you'll do them -- so you'll give it to us simultaneously so that we can see how the two fit together.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAgain, I think that's what we're targeting, but we'll have to see how it plays out and our work progresses.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. In that same vein, Charlie, as you're thinking about all of this, you talk about not having too much of an expense dollar relative to your peers. How much of this -- where you find businesses where it's because you just don't have enough scale on the revenue side, are you thinking you're going to exit some of those businesses? What are you thinking there? Are you thinking about more business exits? Any thoughts on that?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. That's a good question, Vivek. I think we've talked about this a little bit over the last couple of quarters. There absolutely are some things that we do which either we don't have scale in or it just might not be big enough to have an impact on the company going forward, and it's not clear that integral to us being able to fulfill the primary banking relationships that we have from the consumer to the small business and middle-market up to the corporate.\nSo I think as we think about what the company should look like, we absolutely are looking at those things. And so we would certainly expect that we would continue to, I think John has used the word, prune some of these some of these things that exist inside the company as we've been doing. I don't think about them in terms of \u00e2\u0080\u0093 say, differently. The five lines of business that we've determined we do believe are key to the future of the company.\nBut when you go below that, there's certainly some activities which might not meet our criteria for continuing to be here.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. And then when you give us these combined reviews, will you give us some sense of -- we've heard about your need to spend more in technology, areas that you're behind in. Would you give us some sense also where that stands business by business and what you need to do and how that sort of dovetails with the numbers, too?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nListen, we'll see when we get closer to the level of detail that we go through with you. But certainly, the work that we're doing contemplates the fact that we don't want to stand still in our businesses.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners LLC -- Analyst\nGood afternoon. Thank you. Two questions. One, and I apologize if you've already covered this, but I transitioned over late from the Citigroup call, what were the variables that went into your thinking on the level of the dividend? I mean, this is a level that you didn't have to worry about it again.\nWas it a function of what you think your core earnings power is going forward, or is it a desire to build capital more? What were the variables that get you to that level?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nA handful of things, of course. And with the expectation that it's likely that the constraints on the calculation of allowable dividend hang around for a while, even though they may not but they certainly may, if we found a level that we believe is something that gives us more of an upside ability as the COVID environment clears up as the medium-term earnings power of the company becomes more known, both in terms of sources of revenue and what's happening with expense, etc., so that we wouldn't end up or have a low likelihood of ending up in an environment where we're making repeated changes to the dividend. So not so much about -- our capital levels are fine. We have $23-ish billion of excess on top of our regulatory capital requirements.\nAnd we feel it's gone up, as you may have observed. And that's even after building a $20 billion allowance. So not so much capital sufficiency. Although in the future could turn out differently than we and others are planning right now but really more about thinking about the core earnings power and a resulting upward trajectory when the time is right.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd, Charles, I would just add, I know we certainly appreciate the multiple calls that are going on today, and it's a busy day for you all. I would encourage you to go back and look at the prepared remarks because we did walk through the thinking.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners LLC -- Analyst\nGood. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, there's a June 22 letter from 40 or 50, 60 congressmen on both sides of the aisle, so bipartisan and addressed Mnuchin and Powell. And in this letter, they warn of a looming crisis in the CRE and particularly the CMBS market.\nAnd they asked for help from the treasury and the Fed. I was curious what actions you think they might be thinking about taking to support the CMBS market? Or what actions would you like to see them take?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nI don't know if we have an opinion on what actions we'd like to see them take. I do think that, as between the risk owners and CMBS transactions and servicers and borrowers, people should be looking to maximize recovery value. But the contracts are pretty thoughtful. This isn't the first downturn that those market participants have been through.\nAnd my expectation is that a lot of decision-making power is going to end up in the hands of special servicers, and I don't know how to -- I don't know why it would be a good idea to impose some other regime on top of that that changes those contracts. But I don't have a careful, thoughtful review of what's being proposed.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners LLC -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nOur final question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nHello, Gerard.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Hi, John. I apologize if you touched on this already, but when you guys gave us in Slide 2 -- or I'm sorry, Slide 3, the number of customers you have helped with deferring payments and waiving fees, can you give us some color on the trend in terms of the applications for these deferrals? I assume they were very heavy early on, and they have faded downwards. And then second, how many of the customers that have come up for renewal have actually asked for a second extension for the deferrals?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, it's different by loan category. And yes, it's true that the people initially asking was sort of a high point. Our peak was the second week in April. I think, on average, we had about 60,000 or 70,000 accounts per day who were asking.\nWe've dropped, well, almost entirely. I think we're at 4,000 a day for the week of late June. So if that's helpful. And then, of course, the extension question is related to how long was the initial deferral to begin with.\nAnd in general, I would say that more people are getting comfortable with coming out the other side. But yes, we still have a good base of folks who are in deferral.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAnd then second, John, have you guys got any color from the Fed on how long they're going to be supportive of the industry, yourselves included, in granting these deferrals without having to reclassify the loans and put more capital against them?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nI don't think we've got a specific conclusion on that. Although we do assume that there's going to be some point in time after which whether it's the regulators, not only the Fed, and/or our accounting convention is going to cause us to have to consider these as something other than a performing loan. It might be different by category. It might be different by regulator.\nBut the longer we go on, the greater the risk of that.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. And lastly, thank you again for the great detail that you guys given your commercial and industrial loan portfolio. And I noticed, as you mentioned, the increase in nonaccruals on Page 17, the different categories. Can you give us some color on the real estate and construction? The nonaccruals went to $290 million up from, I guess, it was $49 million in the prior quarter.\nBut how much was construction versus loans to the non-depository financials?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nI don't think I have the breakout in front of me, but I can have the IR team follow up with you.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK, great. I appreciate it, John. Thank you.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYou bet.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAll right, guys. Well, listen, thank you very much for the time. We appreciate it, and we will talk to you soon.

{"date": "Jan 15, 2021, 10:00 a.m. ET", "exchange": "NYSE: WFC", "q": "2020-Q4", "ticker": "WFC", "transcript": "Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nGood morning. My name is Catherine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo fourth-quarter 2020 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nThank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO,\u00a0Charlie Scharf,\u00a0and our CFO,\u00a0Mike Santomassimo,\u00a0will discuss fourth-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth-quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie Scharf. \nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, John, and good morning to everyone. I'll make some brief comments about the operating environment, our fourth-quarter results, and I'll discuss our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth-quarter results in more detail before we both take your questions. I'm going to start by making some brief comments about the economy based on what we're seeing.\nThe benefits from both fiscal and monetary stimulus continue to provide important support for many, and the additional $900 billion stimulus is an important step in helping those who are still in need. Though there was solid economic growth in the fourth quarter, we continue to see an uneven recovery, and increases in COVID cases toward the end of the quarter is negatively impacting the path to recovery. Overall, our customers continue to be in a much stronger position than we would have anticipated when this crisis began. But unemployment levels remain high, inventory levels remain lower than pre-pandemic levels, and confidence to invest is dependent on an effective bridge until broad-based vaccination can be accomplished.\nGiven this, we expect 2021 will get off to a slow start, but there is great potential in the second half of the year for a strong 2021, especially if there is another significant stimulus package. Before turning to our performance this quarter, let me discuss our new business segments. One of my early observations when I joined the company was that we were not managing the company at the level of granularity necessary. As a result, we made significant changes to the management structure, most notably having more of our businesses report directly to me.\nThat change also drove us to completely alter our internal reporting to provide us with more transparency into our performance and underlying business drivers and give us the data necessary for us to create plans to improve our performance. This is how we now manage the company with reporting and reviews conducted at a business level at which decisions are made, a big change from what had been the practice. As you can now see, we've also made meaningful changes to our external reporting with the goal of giving our investors a clear understanding of our results, as well as the ability to compare our businesses on a more like-for-like basis to competitors and track our performance as we do internally. What you see now is what we've been reviewing internally.\nOur strengths and weaknesses should be clearer to you than ever, but the potential for improvement should also be clear. The changes go well beyond the addition of business segments. We've reevaluated capital allocation, how we do funds transfer pricing, as well as our internal expense and revenue allocations. We have also added more detailed revenue and performance metric disclosures to help you have more transparency into our results.\nWe think these disclosures are an important step forward in showing you the size and scope of our businesses, as well as forming the basis for how we talk about them going forward. We hope you find it helpful as you evaluate our results and our potential. I'm going to let Mike take you through the results of the fourth quarter in detail, but they continue to be affected by the ongoing impact of COVID, as well as our actions to improve performance and put our past issues behind us. While rates have begun to move upward, the overall level and shape of the yield curve continued to be a significant drag on our net interest income.\nAnd for now, we have limited flexibility to offset these headwinds with balance sheet growth given our constraints of operating under an asset cap. In terms of major business trends, corporate loan demand remained soft, driven by continued strong capital markets conditions and an improving but still uncertain economic backdrop. Credit continues to perform well as both consumers and companies have benefited from accommodations, ongoing fiscal and monetary stimulus and an improving economic outlook. Actual charge-off rates are at multiyear lows.\nBut again, the ultimate timing and magnitude of losses depend on the broader recovery. On consumer spending, we're seeing a continuation of the trend observed in the second half of the year. Debit spend is up double digits, while credit volumes have largely stabilized at flat to down low single digits compared to the prior year. Recently, we've seen the impact of the new stimulus with roughly half of the dollars that were deposited into accounts being spent.\nAll in all, our returns remain significantly below where they should be or what this organization is capable of, but we are taking significant actions. Our agenda is clear and we're making progress, though it will take some time. Our focus is as follows: number one, building the right management team; number two, making progress on our risk and control build-out and satisfying our regulatory obligations; number three, put our significant historical issues, including legal and customer remediations, behind us; number four, reviewing our business, exit activities that are noncore and focus our efforts on building our core scaled businesses and capitalizing on the power of an integrated Wells Fargo; and lastly, identifying and beginning to implement changes to make us a better run and more efficient company. I will briefly cover each of these.\nFirst, on the management team. We've transformed the team by value -- by elevating strong internal talent while bringing in people with the experience and skills necessary for our success. Our operating committee, which are the 18 senior most members of the company responsible for running it, is an entirely new management team. Over two-thirds are new to the company or their role.\nOf the 17 members, other than myself, I've hired nine leaders from outside the company, four others are in different roles and four were relatively new to the company when I joined. Each member has expertise and experience in their area of responsibility and brings a diverse set of skills, backgrounds, tenures and perspectives to our discussions and decisions. Our broader group of senior leaders is also a new team. Nearly half of our top 150 leaders are new to their role from the start of 2020, including over 40 who are new to the organization.\nRegarding our risk and control build-out, in 2020, we announced an enhanced corporate risk organizational structure to provide greater oversight of all risk-taking activities and a more comprehensive view of risk across the company. We made a number of important hires throughout the year. In just the fourth quarter, a new chief compliance officer and new chief risk officers in consumer and small business banking, commercial banking and wealth management have joined the company. These and the many other leaders that joined the company in 2020, who have done similar work at other institutions, have been critical to the early progress we are making.\nAs we announced last week, the OCC terminated a 2015 consent order related to the company's Bank Secrecy Act anti-money laundering compliance program. This is just one accomplishment for us, but it's evidence of the progress we're making and our ability to build the right risk and control infrastructure and remediate our legacy issues. However, this is a multiyear journey. Progress may not be a straight line.\nWe still have significant work to do, but we are diligently doing what's necessary, issue by issue. It will continue to be our top priority to dedicate all necessary resources and make meaningful progress on this critical work. In addition to the continued investment we are making to build out the risk and control infrastructure, we're also moving with urgency much more than had been done before I arrived to put our substantial legacy issues behind us. This includes working through our legal and customer remediation matters, which are almost entirely tied to our historical issues.\nIn doing this work, we're committed to treating customers fairly. To provide some context, this work is complex, oftentimes involves going back many, many years and looking across multiple platforms and systems. We've also had new leaders come in this year, and as a team, we've been diligently working through it, issue by issue. It requires this level of rigor.\nWe've made significant progress over the course of 2020. And it's absolutely critical that we get this work done so we can do what is right for customers and move our organization forward. Over the past year, I've discussed our businesses with an eye toward assessing strategic fit to the company, assessing risk/return profiles and creating a road map for improved operational and financial performance. Our goal is to be the preeminent provider of core financial services in the U.S., and in doing so, seek to reward all stakeholders, including investors, employees, customers and the communities where we do business.\nWe believe our business model as a fully integrated U.S. bank with significant scale and breadth of capabilities positions us to achieve our goal and that we are only -- and that we are one of only a few who have this position, though we do compete with thousands. Our strategy is about becoming even crisper about our target market and taking actions necessary to leverage our strong competitive position. We are clear on who we are.\nOur core target market is U.S. consumers and businesses of all sizes. We do have capabilities outside the U.S., but these activities are predominantly to support our core U.S. customers with their global needs or are in domains where we have scale and expertise to compete locally.\nWe provide the same capabilities for both consumers and companies of all sizes, though the words we use to describe what we do is sometimes different. We are a trusted advisor and provide core banking services, including deposits, capital, payments and investments. Capital includes both private and public access to debt and equity. Our scale and sophistication allows us to have a differentiated physical presence and technology platform you can compete with.\nThe importance of scale is clear and will continue to increase. We have the right businesses at Wells Fargo to achieve our goal. Our individual businesses are strong and valuable. We have excellent individual franchises that compare favorably to all competitors, large and small.\nWe have the products and services, people and scale to be a leader in each, and each has opportunities to serve customers more broadly and improve its own financial profile. I wouldn't confuse our recent underperformance with our great franchise value and how our business fits together to put us in a great competitive position. And then, there is the great power of an integrated Wells Fargo. While our businesses are strong individually, they are even more powerful when working together.\nThough we talk about separate lines of business, we operate as one company in our communities. Our branches serve our consumers and small businesses, as well as commercial banking and corporate clients. Our ability to support our local communities is based on that breadth locally but also by the support and resources of Wells Fargo nationally. At times, our lines of business has served as artificial boundaries for us, delivering the very best for our customers and clients.\nWe're breaking down those barriers to more effectively serve our customers, and each should add to our profitability and returns. We have opportunities across our entire franchise, but just a few examples include serving low to moderate income, as well as more affluent consumers consistently across our platform, payments and investment banking for our commercial clients. We've completed the review of our businesses and are taking action for those that aren't core to our mission. In the past few months, we've announced sales or intention to exit the student loan business, international wealth management and direct equipment finance in Canada.\nWe are also in the process of exploring options for asset management, corporate trust and our rail portfolio. As I said, we are focusing all of our efforts on our core scale businesses. And these other activities, which may be good businesses, are not consistent with the core strategic priorities I just outlined. And we're taking actions to run a better company, which is far more efficient.\nI've acknowledged many times that our returns are below where they should be and what this company can deliver. I pointed out that our efficiency ratio is not competitive. You can now see this by line of business as well, and it is an important data point to guide us to drive efficiency and simplicity in how we manage the company. As we do this, we will reduce complexity and risk, and our expenses should decrease even as we continue to reinvest in building our infrastructure and growing the company.\nAs we look at financial goals, today, we're targeting our overall expense level and return on tangible common equity. And just to be clear, we will spend whatever is necessary to complete our risk and regulatory build-out. We have started to take significant actions. Mike will share the details of our initiatives and our expense outlook.\nBut I would like to emphasize that we will continue to be cautious about putting firm time frames around our goals. We're making dramatic changes to put us in a position to capture our full potential, but we do have constraints today that impact our ability in the shorter term to realize our earnings and return potential or to commit to firm time lines. We remain subject to an asset cap as part of our consent order with the Federal Reserve, and we must prioritize balance sheet usage more so than if it was not a limitation, a significant constraint, especially given the current operating environment. Though we believe we are making meaningful progress, there is substantial work to do.\nWe're also temporarily limited in our ability to return capital to shareholders due to special restrictions placed on the largest banks by the Federal Reserve due to the uncertainties around COVID. As the path to economic recovery becomes clear, these restrictions should be lifted, and we will be able to return excess capital to shareholders through a combination of higher dividends and share buybacks. And the negative impact to our results from COVID is clear and will likely continue until broad-based vaccinations allow for a clear and even economic recovery. As these headwinds abate, our earnings and returns should benefit materially.\nWe're taking action for things in our control, but we'll remain cautious until there's more clarity around when these constraints will recede. That said, we're hopeful that our actions to increase efficiency in the company and the ability to return excess capital to our shareholders, creates a clear path to a return on tangible common equity in excess of 10%. Beyond that, the ability to grow our balance sheet, higher interest rates and executing on additional efficiency and growth initiatives presents a path to longer-term ROTCE of around 15%. Again, it's hard to put specific time frames around these goals with any confidence today, but we're confident that our franchise is capable.\nI mentioned we continue to have significant excess capital above our regulatory requirements. Last month, the Federal Reserve authorized the nation's largest banks to pay common stock dividends and make share repurchases in the first quarter that, in aggregate, do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the firm's net income for the four preceding calendar quarters. Based on this criteria, we have the capacity to return approximately $800 million in the first quarter. Assuming the board declares a first quarter dividend consistent with the past two quarters, under the Federal Reserve's criteria, we expect to have common stock repurchase capacity in the first quarter of approximately $600 million, including repurchases for employee compensation.\nReturning capital to shareholders remains a priority. Our board of directors has also approved an increase in our authority to repurchase common stock by an additional 500 million shares, bringing the total authorized amount to 667 million shares. In summary, we are taking meaningful actions and believe we have line of sight to a double-digit ROTCE ratio. While returning to low double-digit ROTCE would mean an improvement from where we are operating today, as I've said before, I continue to believe there is no structural reason why we shouldn't be able to generate comparable returns to our peers over the longer term, and that continues to be the goal.\n2020 was certainly a challenging year for all, but I'm proud of what Wells Fargo and my more than 265,000 partners have done to support our customers, our country and our communities. We've begun a multiyear process of transforming Wells Fargo, and I look forward to making more progress in 2021. I want to thank everyone at Wells for what they've done through an extremely difficult set of circumstances, and I look forward to a better 2021. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. First, I'd like to thank John Shrewsberry for all his partnership over the last few months and wish him success in the future. I'm going to review our fourth-quarter results, and then I will provide some information on our expectations on a few additional topics. 2020 was a challenging year, and I'm proud of the support we provided to our customers, communities and employees, which we highlight on Slide 2.\nWe summarize our consolidated financial results for the fourth quarter on Slide 3. Net income for the quarter was $3 billion or $0.64 per common share. Our effective income tax rate was 3.5%, which was lower than we expected due to discrete tax benefits related to resolving some legacy tax matters. We expect our effective income tax rate for the full year of 2021 to be in the mid-single digits.\nOur fourth-quarter results also included $781 million in restructuring charges. Similar to the third quarter, these charges included severance expense, but the fourth quarter also included charges for software impairment and costs related to reducing our real estate footprint. We also had a $757 million reserve release due to the announcement that we are selling our student loan portfolio, which is expected to close in the first half of this year. Finally, we had $321 million of customer remediation accruals primarily for a variety of historical matters, down $640 million from the third quarter.\nOur capital and liquidity remained strong. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.6% under the standardized approach and 11.9% under the advanced approach. Our liquidity coverage ratio was 133%. We continue to have significant excess capital with $31 billion over the regulatory minimum, and we hope to return more to shareholders this year.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our net charge-off ratio in the fourth quarter was 26 basis points, the lowest it's been in a number of years and certainly better than what we would have predicted earlier in the year. As we've previously mentioned, although our customers seem to be in better shape than we would have forecasted, the accommodations we've provided since the start of the pandemic are also helping delay the recognition of the charge-offs, which is reflected in our allowance level. Nonperforming assets increased 9% from the third quarter.\nCommercial nonaccrual loans increased $381 million, primarily due to a small number of commercial real estate exposures. While there is still a lot of uncertainty regarding commercial real estate, the performance has been better than expected as our customers are benefiting from low interest rates, which is helping them preserve liquidity. It's also important to note that approximately 70% of our commercial nonaccrual loans were current on interest and principal as of the end of the fourth quarter. Consumer nonaccrual loans increased $325 million on higher consumer real estate and auto nonaccruals.\nOur allowance coverage ratio was unchanged versus the third quarter. Similar to the third quarter, while observed performance was strong, there was still a significant amount of uncertainty reflected in our allowance level at the end of the fourth quarter. Just a reminder that the reserve release in the fourth quarter was almost entirely due to the announcement that we were selling the student loan portfolio. As we show on Slide 6, the percentage of our consumer loan portfolio that remained in a COVID-related payment deferral as of the end of the fourth quarter decreased to 3% with declines across all the portfolios.\nWe are no longer offering COVID-related deferrals except for home lending and new deferral requests are down significantly. Loans that have already exited deferral are performing better than we anticipated with over 90% of the balances current as of the end of the year. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Our average loans declined for the second consecutive quarter and were down 6% from a year ago.\nThe decline in commercial loans from the third quarter was driven by lower commercial and industrial loans as demand remained weak and line utilization continued to be very low amid strong capital markets and soft economic background. On the consumer side, residential real estate loans declined as prepayment rates remained elevated. Lower consumer balances also reflected the transfer of student loans to held for sale. We had strong deposit growth throughout the year with average consumer deposits up 19% from a year ago.\nHowever, average deposits in the fourth quarter decreased modestly on a linked-quarter basis, driven by intentional runoff of certain deposits, primarily in corporate treasury and corporate investment banking, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Net interest income declined 17% from a year ago as lower interest rates drove a repricing of the balance sheet. The decline also reflected lower loan balances and investment securities, as well as higher mortgage-backed security premium amortization.\nNet interest income declined modestly from the third quarter, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower interest rates, which drove balance sheet repricing. These declines were partially offset by higher investment securities and trading assets, higher commercial loan fees, higher hedge ineffectiveness accounting results and lower mortgage-backed security premium amortization, As a result, our net interest margin was flat compared with the third quarter. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense was down 5% from a year ago and 3% from the third quarter.\nThe decline from the third quarter was driven by lower operating losses and declines in other nonpersonnel expense, including lower professional and outside service expense primarily due to efficiency initiatives implemented toward the end of the year. These declines were partially offset by higher personnel expense, driven primarily by the timing of incentive compensation expense. Our expenses in the fourth quarter also reflected the restructuring charges that I highlighted earlier on the call. And as a reminder, we typically see seasonally higher personnel expense in the first quarter.\nTurning to our business segments. Starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 10. Net income increased versus both third-quarter 2020 and fourth-quarter 2019 as lower revenue was more than offset by lower expenses and a decline in the provision for credit losses. Home lending revenue of approximately $2 billion declined 21% from the third quarter as servicing income declined, driven by MSR valuation adjustments, reflecting higher prepayments and increased servicing cost.\nNet interest income was down due to a decline in loan balances and lower interest rates, and revenue also declined as lower mortgage originations were only partially offset by higher spreads. Versus the fourth quarter of 2019, home lending revenue was up slightly as higher net gains on mortgage originations were partially offset by lower net interest income due to lower balances, loan balances and interest rates, a decrease in gains on the sale of loan portfolios and lower servicing income. Credit card revenue increased 2% from the third quarter, driven by lower deferrals and seasonally higher spend. Average balances grew modestly from the third quarter but were down 9% from a year ago as COVID-related headwinds persisted.\nAverage deposits grew 18% from a year ago, reflecting COVID-related impacts, including government stimulus programs. This deposit growth represents long-term opportunities as we work to build on these important deposit relationships with new and existing customers. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 10% from a year ago.\nWhile retail originations increased 17%, correspondent originations declined 33% from a year ago as we maintain margins in a more competitive market and suspended nonconforming correspondent originations earlier in 2020. Auto originations declined 22% from a year ago and were down 2% from the third quarter. Our underwriting policies remain slightly more conservative than pre-COVID levels. Turning to debit card.\nBoth transactions and dollar volume increased linked quarter. While purchase volume increased 11% from a year ago, transactions were down 2% as customers made fewer purchases but spent more per transaction. As a reminder, debit card fees are based primarily on transaction volume, not dollar volume. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume has rebounded from second-quarter lows, and fourth-quarter volume was up 8% from the third quarter and relatively stable from a year ago.\nCommercial Banking net income was up from the third quarter, driven by a decline in the provision for credit losses but was down versus the fourth-quarter 2019 on lower revenue. Middle market banking revenue declined 4% from the third quarter, driven by lower net interest income due to lower loan balances and was down 26% from a year ago, primarily driven by the impact of lower interest rates -- that the lower interest rates had on what we earned on deposits and lower loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue grew 5% from the third quarter, driven by higher loan syndication fees and valuation gains on equity investments, but was down from a year ago due to lower interest rates and loan balances. Noninterest expenses declined 4% from the third quarter, partially reflecting efforts to increase efficiency and client coverage and streamline the organization.\nWhile overall headcount was down, we've hired more bankers in key markets to drive new business growth in our middle market business. Average loans declined for the third consecutive quarter with revolving credit line utilization at very low levels. Loan balances started to stabilize late in the fourth quarter, but loan demand remains weak overall, reflecting continued high liquidity levels, strength in the capital markets and lower inventory levels. Turning to corporate investment banking on Slide 13.\nBanking revenue growth from the third quarter was driven by an 18% increase in investment banking revenue on higher advisory fees and equity origination. The investment banking pipeline remains strong at year-end. Commercial real estate revenue grew 15% from the third quarter, driven by higher CMBS volumes and improved gain on sale margins, as well as an increase in low-income housing tax credit income. The 12% growth in revenue from a year ago was primarily driven by our low income housing business, which in the fourth quarter of 2019 included lower revenue due to the timing of expected tax benefit recognition.\nMarkets revenue declined 26% from the third quarter on trading volumes -- lower trading volumes across fixed income and equities. Overall, 2020 was a good year with strong performance across fixed income and equities, especially during the first half of the year. However, our results were impacted in part due to actions we took to reduce trading-related assets in order to manage under the asset cap. Noninterest expense declined 10% from the third quarter, primarily reflecting the timing of incentive compensation accruals.\nAnd average deposits declined 20% with average trading assets were down 19% from a year ago, primarily driven by actions we've taken to proactively manage deposits and other liabilities. Wealth and investment management net income increased 16% from the third quarter, driven by revenue growth primarily reflecting higher asset-based fees, Noninterest expense increased 2% from the third quarter, driven by higher revenue-based compensation. Versus the fourth quarter of 2019, net income increased reflecting the impact of lower interest rates on net interest income, which was more than offset by lower expenses due to onetime charges in 2019. Average loans increased 5% from a year ago, with growth in both securities-based lending and nonconforming mortgages.\nAverage deposits grew 22% from a year ago, and we ended the year with a record client assets of $2 trillion, up 6% from a year ago. Wells Fargo asset management -- assets under management of $603 billion increased 18% from a year ago due to net flows into money market funds and higher market valuations. Corporate on Slide 15 includes corporate treasury and staff functions, as well as our investment portfolio and affiliated venture capital and private equity partnerships. And it also includes certain lines of business that we've determined are no longer consistent with our long-term strategic goals or have previously divested.\nIn the quarter, this primarily includes our student loan business, institutional retirement and trust, rail and our direct equipment finance business in Canada. Turning now to our expectations for 2021, starting with net interest income on Slide 16. As a starting point, if you were to annualize the fourth quarter's net interest income, you get approximately $36.8 billion. We currently expect full-year 2021 net interest income to be flat to down 4% from this level.\nIt's important to note that approximately 1% of the potential decline is driven by the announced sale of our student loan portfolio. Our assumptions to get to the top end of this range include interest rates that generally follow the implicit -- that are those implicit in the current forward curve. It is worth noting that while the recent increase in rates is helpful, rates remain below levels at which most of our portfolio was originated, and that results in some ongoing downward yield pressure as we reinvest cash. We also assumed stable total loan balances from the fourth quarter with a modest reduction in the proportion of consumer loan balances consistent with recent trends.\nTo achieve this, we would need some improvement in loan demand, which has been soft across the industry for the past couple of quarters. Additionally, mortgage balances will likely continue to see headwinds in 2021 given the elevated level of prepayments, which have exceeded portfolio originations and given the expected sale or resecuritization of loans previously purchased out of agency mortgage securitizations. Finally, we assume stable to modestly improving credit spreads across major loan and securities categories. Recently, we have seen significant tightening, and most credit-sensitive assets are now trading through the pre-COVID levels of early 2020.\nOur net interest income expectations for 2021 are -- also assume the asset capital remain in place. Regarding the asset cap, we are focused on getting the work done properly and believe we're making progress. However, there remains a significant amount of work to do and a series of steps required by the consent order, requiring both successful execution and implementation by us, and ultimately, a determination by the Federal Reserve as to when the work has been completed to their satisfaction. Recognizing we are early in the year and uncertainties exist, the range we have provided reflects the potential for pressures on each of these assumptions.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 17. We're focused on building a more efficient company with a streamlined organizational structure and less complexity so we can better serve our customers. Our efficiency initiatives are designed to improve staffing models, reduce bureaucracy and lower reliance on expensive outside resources. Importantly, we're not seeking efficiencies related to the resources needed to complete our regulatory and control work, and we'll continue to add if necessary.\nWe have rigorous reviews to help ensure that we have the required resources in place to complete this important work. We are executing on a portfolio of over 250 efficiency initiatives, which we expect to span over the next three to four years. They amount to over $8 billion of identified potential gross saves that are concentrated in the five categories that we highlight on the slide. In addition to these initiatives, we have a long list of others that are in the process of being vetted.\nWhile we are focused on becoming more efficient, we will continue to invest in our risk and regulatory work, as well as to support business growth and improve our products and services. We are not forgoing opportunities with good returns to grow revenue even if they may increase expenses. We are targeting net expense reductions each year and our restructuring charges become clearer. We will build our growth plans -- and as we build our growth plans each year, we will provide further details.\nWe provide some selected details on our efficiency initiatives on Slide 18. And as you can see, some of these initiatives are companywide while others are business specific. As we've streamlined our organizational structure, we've been able to reduce layers of management across businesses and functions, which has increased the average span of control by approximately 10%. Our flatter organizational structure has also given us the opportunity to reduce support function headcount and reapply these savings in the growth areas.\nWe've also had the opportunity to reduce our nonbranch real estate by using our space more efficiently. We currently have approximately 46 million square feet of real estate, which we expect to reduce by 15% to 20% by the end of 2024. Much of this reduction is due to our underutilization of the space pre-COVID. Turning to some of the business-specific opportunities.\nAs of year-end 2020, we had 5,032 branches, which is down from a peak of over 6,600 in 2009. Reflecting the acceleration of digital adoption and usage from other customers, we closed 329 branches in 2020 and expect to close approximately 250 more this year. We are also changing our branch staffing model to better reflect the activity that's occurring within the branches, which is less transactional and resulted in an approximately 20% reduction in branch staff in 2020. We will continue to adjust staffing in response to changing customer needs.\nWe have also identified opportunities in our home lending and auto businesses. In the fourth quarter, 73% of home lending's retail applications were sourced through our online mortgage application tool, and we expect to continue to improve our digital capabilities in the origination process, which makes for a better customer experience and is expected to reduce expenses. As the economic environment improves and the processes become more technology-driven, we expect significant home lending servicing efficiencies over the next four years. In our auto business, we're investing in our loan origination system and credit decision tools, which we expect will increase decision automation to more than 70 -- automation to more than 70% by 2022, up from 59% in 2020, enhancing the customer experience while improving controls.\nWe also have significant opportunities within Commercial Banking, including changing how we serve our customers and optimizing operations and other back office teams, which is expected to reduce headcount and expenses. This includes working to reduce the number of commercial banking lending platforms by over 50% and standardizing and automating customer onboarding, which should reduce cost, but more importantly, improve the customer experience. Turning to our 2021 expense outlook on Slide 19. We reported $57.6 billion of noninterest expense in 2020.\nIncluded in that were $2.2 billion of customer remediation accruals and $1.5 billion of restructuring charges. So a good starting point for discussion of 2021 expenses is approximately $54 billion. If market levels remain strong, we expect to see an increase in revenue-related compensation of approximately $500 million in 2021, primarily in wealth management. This impact may increase if markets or business performance exceeds our expectations.\nWe expect to realize $3.7 billion of gross expense reductions in 2021. This will be partially offset by incremental spending in a few important areas, including personnel and technology, including investments in risk and regulatory work. After factoring in incremental spending, our net reduction for 2021 is expected to be approximately $1.5 billion with reductions accelerating through the year. Our full-year 2021 expenses, excluding restructuring charges and business exits, are expected to be approximately $53 billion, with lower annualized expenses toward the end of the year.\nIn prior expense outlooks, we assumed $600 million of annual operating losses, which is still the normal amount of losses we have for theft and fraud-related items. However, we also typically have some level of customer remediation accruals and litigation costs, which are hard to predict, but we've assumed approximately $1 billion for total operating losses in our 2021 outlook. While we made significant progress on working through our legacy issues, we still have significant outstanding litigation and regulatory issues that can be unpredictable. The restructuring charges we took in 2020 reflect what we believe will be needed for 2021 headcount reductions.\nWhile we haven't included any restructuring charges in our 2020 outlook, we may have some smaller amounts, primarily real estate-related, and we will evaluate later this year the need for additional severance and/or restructuring charges for initiatives in 2022 with a focus on ensuring the payback periods continue to be strong. We will call out these charges as appropriate as we move through the year. We made significant progress in 2020 in identifying efficiency opportunities across our businesses, and we started executing on these initiatives resulting in the restructuring charges during the second half of the year. This is just the beginning of a multiyear process, and our ultimate goal is to improve our efficiency while continuing to invest in our businesses.\nNow on Slide 20. We've finished our business reviews, and we've updated you on our expense expectations. Now let's turn to what we, as a management team, are ultimately focused on, improving our returns. We believe we have a clear line of sight to increase our return on tangible common equity to approximately 10% in the short term if we continue to reduce expenses and we were able to optimize our capital levels closer to our internal target.\nAfter that, we believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors, including moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted, a modest increase in interest rates or furthering steepening of the curve, our ongoing progress or incremental efficiency initiatives, a small impact from returns on growth-related investments in our businesses and continued execution on our risk, regulatory and controls work. The combination of these factors, we believe, would take our return on tangible common equity from approximately 10% to approximately 15% over time. To be clear, this is a multiyear process dependent on the path of the economic recovery and requires successful execution on our part, particularly in controlling expenses, as well as an improved operating environment. But the takeaway is that we believe our business model is capable of producing these returns.\nWe will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Mike, I thought I want to get -- could ask about the expense slide on Page 19. Is the right way to look at it that you said you've identified over $8 billion of gross saving opportunities and you're realizing -- you expect to realize $3.7 billion of that $8 billion or so in '21?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, hey, John, thanks for the question. Yeah, at this point, that's where we are. We've got a little -- probably a little over $8 billion that we are sort of working on as we speak, and we'll get $3.7 billion in the year. And as I said in the commentary, those savings get bigger as you go throughout the year.\nSo that implies the exit rates better than the $53 billion.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And if you think about the gross to net, you're realizing $1.5 billion of net saves for like $3.7 billion of gross, maybe 40% of the $3.7 billion you're achieving. Is that ratio of gross to net -- could that improve in the out years based on what your investment spend forecast is?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. You have to sort of think about it that you don't get the benefit all day one. These things sort of take -- get executed throughout the year. So that ratio of $8 billion to $3.7 billion, you can't really look at it or -- I'm sorry, the ratio of $8 billion to the sort of net that you're seeing.\nYou sort of have to look at that over a couple-year period as you get the full annualized benefit of all the saves coming into the P&L.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nJohn, this is Charlie. How you doing?\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHey, Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI would also just add to that in that, the $1.6 billion of investments that's broken out on Slide 19, that does include a significant continued increase in expenses related to the risk and infrastructure build-out that we have. And so as we continue to move forward, there's a point at which that -- the increase certainly slows.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nGotcha. OK. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMorning.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nA couple of questions. One, Charlie, you walked through the businesses that you have sold or are in the process of contemplating selling. Is -- should we take that to mean that that's the full extent of what you're looking to do with the business model at this stage and that there's anything else beyond those areas are not being contemplated for sale? Or maybe just give us some color on that. And then, how you identified what to keep? Like what was the bar for sale versus retain?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Yeah. I think the answer is yes. You should look at this as the complete list with the one aside that all companies should always relook at this on a regular basis to make sure that whatever assumptions you've made are accurate.\nBut we've gone through an exhaustive review of everything that we do business by business at a level of detail well beyond the level that we report publicly. We've come up with these activities. We've thought about a whole bunch of other things. And so this is the list that we're actively working on, and we feel very good about everything else.\nAs we think about the lens that we use, it starts with, we look at the core customer base that we want to serve. And is it part of our capabilities that we have either targeted toward that customer base? Or are they part of a package that's logically offered to customers as one? Also look at risk/returns. I would just make a comment on risk/returns because I've heard a little -- people talking about this a little bit. It's -- we're not looking at the risk/return of a given quarter.\nWe're looking at the risk/return over a much longer life cycle of these businesses. And so you add that together and the businesses that we're exiting, they are perfectly good businesses. And the things that we are thinking about, there's certainly -- the question is, are they best housed within Wells Fargo? And so we think the answer is probably best housed someplace else. There are different ways to get there and different arrangements that we can have with folks in terms of what that means.\nBut again, I do feel very good at this point that we've looked across the enterprise.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThen you've outlined where there's been a pullback in loan balances or earning assets because of these exits. But what do you do with that opportunity there? I mean, there's a lot of discussion, as you well know, about the asset cap and it's hard to know when you get out of it. But are you creating room for your core businesses to grow into that space? Or how are you thinking about that?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So I guess, I would start with we did not approach this exercise with we have to sell businesses to create room under the asset cap. It was really -- the view was driven by what do we think actually belongs within Wells Fargo for the long term. To the extent that it helps us with the asset cap, that's certainly a benefit.\nBut that was not the lens with which we view this. When you look at what we've done, the education finance business is roughly $10 billion or so in assets. The things that we've announced, that is the most significant piece. And so sure, there's no -- that over time creates the ability for us to redeploy that capacity elsewhere.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. And then, just lastly, on the tax rate. I think you mentioned this year, it's going to be single digits. Can you speak to what's driving that and what your sustainable tax rate is? And also, is there a difference throughout the year like how that tax rate? Is it single digits throughout? Or is it just starts super low and then goes up to normalize by 4Q? Help us think through the seasonality there.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nHey, Betsy, it's Mike. Yes, it bumps around a little bit based on earnings or what's in the quarter. But I think the simple way to think about why it's lower than kind of the past is we've got a significant amount of investments that are multiyear investments in -- whether it's low income housing, other renewable energy that create tax credits. And those tax credits are what's driving -- what's offsetting sort of the normal statutory tax rates that we'd have.\nIt's no more complicated than that. And so as you've seen over the last couple of years, those have increased a bit over time. And so as we sort of look for -- look at 2021, that's the big driver.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThe sustainability -- yeah, go ahead, sorry.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nI was going to say, so the dollar impact of those is up a little bit but, obviously, has a much bigger impact on the rate when you're earning less.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nRight. So I mean, as you earn more, obviously, your tax rate will bleed higher but for a good reason.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nCorrect.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nCorrect.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK, thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Coming back to your Slide 20. Just wondering, I know that that -- it's a path and it's a hypothetical and that long-term ROE is a long ways away.\nBut on that interim step, the 10%, do you have a way of helping us think about what type of time frame might be possible to even get to that middle step, that 10%?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I think -- hey, Ken, how are you? I think the way we're trying to describe it is that is where we have clear line of sight. So when we look at the impact of expenses, these are actions that we are actively taking. But we're also -- in order to get to 10% without any changes to the revenue equation at this point, we also have optimized capital levels, which means that the Fed would have to relax restrictions.\nAnd so the reason why we're not talking about the time frame is because we don't know when that will happen. But the amount of excess capital that we have, as you know, is extraordinarily significant. And we're also in the position of not being able to use it because we have the balance sheet limit. And so the timing is dependent on that.\nBut again, in our minds, very clear line of sight when that occurs, to be able to get there in a relatively short time frame. And then, on the longer-term piece, which you didn't ask about, again, there too -- I think there's some words off on the right-hand side. But again, I would not describe this as just something that we are dreaming about. When we look at what is possible with modest balance sheet growth, really moderate increases in the rate curve or steepening and efficiencies that we believe we can get, we really do believe that that is what we will achieve.\nIt's just -- we're just not in a position to put timing around it because we don't control the timing on most of those items. But when those things become clear, we should be in a position to be clear with you about timing.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nYup. And on a follow-up to the capital and then the potential business sales, how do we get a sense of what earnings might potentially go away with those business sales? And then, if you were to get gains on those business sales, is that capital also kind of contemplated in these ROE improvements? Or would that be extra or incremental use to -- at that point, you're able to do something with the capital generated to offset some of the lost earnings?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I think a couple of things. So it's Mike. Ken, thanks for the question.\nI think we'll give you more detail as sort of we announced plans for each of the businesses. But think of the revenue impacted by the four things Charlie sort of outlined as very low single digits, around a few percent of revenue. And we'll sort of give you more clarity as sort of they come -- the plans come into focus with the timing. And I think you're right.\nAs we -- if we book gains, as we sort of divest of items, that's helpful from a capital perspective. That can either get redeployed in the business or through buyback capacity.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd this is Charlie. Let me just add. Given what we've announced, those are announced transactions, not closed. So it will take a period of time for these things to close.\nSo once you factor into certainly what will impact 2021, it's a smaller amount. And we're working hard at making sure that when we exit businesses, we get the expenses out. It, obviously, frees up capital that we have invested in those businesses, as well as the games. And so you put those things together.\nAnd that's why we don't think of the impact of these things as being material to either a plus or minus on what it means for our ratios. But it cleans up the company. It gets us focused on making sure that we're putting resources toward the right things, and we've just got the company set up properly going forward.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks very much, guys.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question on the NII guidance. What are some of the assumptions informing the lower and upper bound of the guidance range for '21? And maybe more specifically, where are you reinvesting today versus the back book yield of 196 basis points?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Hey, Steven, it's Mike. Look, I think as you sort of think about the top end of the range, we're assuming roughly the implied forward curve, even though that's bumping around day by day, week by week here over the last couple of weeks. So I assume -- we are not assuming much improvement from where it is relative to get to the top of the range.\nWe're assuming loan balances are, in total, roughly flat. We'll see some declines, we think, on the consumer side, particularly in the mortgage book. as we go into this year. But we will -- and so we'll need to see a little bit of growth in commercial and corporate side to get there.\nAnd then, we're assuming spreads are about where they are relative to the other asset classes that we would invest in. And then, a very modest expansion of the securities portfolio, but not very big. So further steepening of the curve kind of increases overall sort of our positive relative to our assumptions. I think the biggest sort of downside risk is what happens to loans, loan growth, particularly on the commercial and corporate side.\nBut a lot of the activity we're seeing from stimulus and what the potential could be in terms of the recovery, particularly in the latter part of the year, should be constructive for that. So I think it's not a Herculean task to sort of get to the top end of the range, but it does require a little bit of growth from -- in the loan book from where we are today. And then, maybe just, I guess, related, I'll give you a little sense of how mortgage -- the mortgage market is sort of doing in the first quarter. We are -- we did have -- the last couple of quarters has been pretty strong for origination and the mortgage origination market.\nAnd as we sort of see the first couple of weeks of January, it's still pretty strong relative to both volume and margin on that balance. So that should be also constructive as we sort of look into Q1.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThat's great color, Mike. And just for my follow-up on capital, you mentioned that you're running with significant excess capital. The strategic actions that have been outlined should significantly derisk the overall loan portfolio. And just given your strong CCAR track record and these derisking efforts, is there room to manage to a lower target versus the 10.5% internal objective? I know you're running above that.\nIt just feels like that might be a little bit too conservative given all the actions that you've taken.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, that's certainly something we think about a lot, Steve, in terms of what's the optimal level to run. I think publicly, we set it around 10%. And as you noted, we're running well above that target.\nSo that's something we'll keep in mind. But as you know, we've been restricted from returning a lot of that back to shareholders at this point. And we always start the conversation first with ensuring that we are allocating enough capital to grow the underlying businesses and invest in them with -- inside the company. But -- and at this point, we're just restricted from returning.\nSo hopeful that will change over time.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd then, this is Charlie. If I could just add, when we think about the conservative capital position that we completely agree with and as we look at our performance over time, as CCAR does, that does allow us to rethink about what you're talking about. You also have to -- we also think about just the position that we have with our allowance for credit losses. And so we're seeing what everyone else is seeing, which is that the performance is substantially better than we would have thought when we went into this and when a lot of those CECL reserves were established.\nBut we've also -- when asked -- we've been very clear in terms of what it takes to start to use that, which is we'd like to see something, which we really do believe is more sustained and more equitable recovery because so many uncertainties exist. So everything that we see is extremely positive. But we think the right thing to do is to be prudent there. And so overall, the only -- really the only meaningful reserves that we reversed were because of the student loan sale, which we had to do.\nBut that positions us from just a quality of balance sheet perspective even stronger going into 2021.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThat's great. Very helpful color. Thank you, both, for taking my questions.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to revert back to that $8 billion plus of potential gross savings in the slide deck. Would you say, are you guys kind of completely done with the reviews that got you to that $8 billion number? Or to what extent are those ongoing? I noticed one of the sub-bullets talks about formalizing a program for additional feedback.\nAnd I guess, the context of the question is, in the past, you guys have noted that $10 billion number as sort of a -- kind of a guidepost that would have gotten you toward peer efficiency. So just trying to sort of square the two together, if $8 billion is sort of all there is or if there's more as time unfolds.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. I think we're actually talking about slightly different things.\nAnd so let me just try and walk through what I mean by that. The $10 billion that I referenced on the call was just the very simple math of our efficiency ratio versus our competitors to say that that is the difference in efficiency between -- with which we run the company and they run the company. And when we look at what Wells is, we don't believe that there's any meaningful difference why that should be different. That doesn't mean that we're going to get to that number in a short period of time because these efficiencies take a long time to build in.\nThey're based upon both expense levels, but also the revenue levels that other people have. And so that was what the math is. But it certainly served as a guidepost for us to sit and say, \"Hey, why are others where they are versus where we are?\" And we didn't look at it just overall. We looked at it by business.\nAnd again, as I mentioned in my comments, now you've got the ability to do more direct comparisons by business so you can see a little bit more of what we've seen. So the $8 billion referenced is what we have -- are the list of initiatives that we have that are in progress of moving forward with. It's a -- as Mike -- as these slides mentioned, it says they're 250 and plus. There really are a list of 250 initiatives that we go through as an operating committee, and each operating committee member is in the process of executing on, which we believe we will be able to reduce, on a gross basis, the expense base by $8 billion.\nAway from that, we are not done. We still -- first of all, it's like peeling an onion back. And so once you get a series of efficiencies, it helps you look at everything else that's left as well. And so we're confident that there'll be more after that, which will help continue this multiyear drive to get to what we think is a reasonable efficiency level over a period of time.\nTo be comparable with our competitors, first of all, it took them years to get there. And so that's why it will take us a fair amount of time as well. We'll accomplish a lot of it through expenses. But we certainly need a higher net interest income, and some growth in our noninterest income expenses would certainly be helpful there.\nSo I still think of efficiency as something longer term that as we focus on just getting the expenses out and focusing on returns, our efficiency ratio will naturally become more competitive as opposed to a specific target in a specific year.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nYup. OK. That's good context, and I appreciate that. And then, separately, just as it relates to the asset cap, so under the new business line reporting, a lot of this becomes a bit more self-evident.\nSo I appreciate that. But just as you guys look at it on a day-to-day basis, what is the asset cap doing to your ability to retract and attain customers at this point? I feel like all this excess liquidity in the form of deposits that's washed into the system over the past nine or 10 months has just been such an embarrassment of money for the industry. But unfortunately, you guys have just a company-specific hurdle in having to manage that dollar amount. So as it relates to sort of customer interface with existing ones and potential ones, how is the cap impacting things at this point?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So let me start, and then Mike can certainly pick up. I think, first of all, we -- I think the way you asked the question is a good and interesting one, and we need to separate the conversation about the asset cap between impacting our financial performance and impact on the franchise. And there's no question that the impact on our financial performance is material in this environment, right? When you just look at -- well, I say when we look at actions that we've had to take to prioritize balance sheet usage in an environment where, certainly, early on, there were significant draws and then those were seated with people's ability to refinance elsewhere.\nBut deposit inflows or having to manage to those things certainly has been a cost to us. And then, I would certainly also add to that, as we think about additional stimulus, we need to create room on the balance sheet to be able to deal with that stimulus, be it fiscal or monetary. And so even versus where our balance sheet was running when we went into the pandemic, just because of this environment, we have to manage it lower in addition to the specific actions that we've had to take because of the requests that we've had both on the asset and the liability side for management of the balance sheet. Then we also think about when we went through the crisis, the ability to add higher-yielding assets when we were focused on staying below an asset cap is something that we were not able to do that others are able to do.\nAnd then, you look at our need not just to keep the balance sheet flat but to have it be incrementally lower to create the capacity versus others' ability to increase it. You add those things together. And financially, in this environment, there's no doubt that it is a really meaningful drag on our ability to offset certainly NII. In terms of the franchise, which is a separate question, as we've gone through the exercise, which we were doing daily, and now we don't do as closely daily but we do it regularly, the conversation that we have is all around where can we make changes or create capacity, which has the least franchise impact.\nSo if you look at what we've done, we're not limiting our consumer deposits, and we've seen very, very strong growth there. We have pulled back on our nonconforming corresponding business for a period of time. We think when we turn that back on, if we're the right provider at the right price, then we'll be in the market for that. Certainly, on our wholesale businesses, they've been more impacted by actions that we've taken.\nI think on the commercial side, we try to be very, very smart. I always say we -- I mean, the team there, Perry and the team, they're trying to be very smart about operational versus nonoperational where our customers have other choices and they understand the position that we're in and the same thing on the corporate investment banking side. So that's just a very long way of saying, I think that we've done a very good job of having as little franchise impact as possible. Hard to say nothing, but I think the places that we've done are places where people have the sophistication to understand why we are doing.\nWe continue to do the other business with them. And it's something that we continue to, obviously, be really thoughtful about. Mike, anything else you'd add?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo, I think that's right. And I -- just to kind of underline what's probably said on the consumer side is that we're not putting any kind of restrictions there. And I think that we're seeing almost a 20% increase in deposit -- in consumer deposits. And I think that's a good sign of how people feel about us and doing more with us.\nAnd so I think that's encouraging to see on the consumer business.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nAll right. That's perfect. Thank you very much for your thoughts. I appreciate you guys taking the questions.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nJust two quick questions. First one on the reserve. I noticed that you said you had the reserve release related to student lending this quarter. But I guess, if you think about the reserve and where it stands as of year-end, I mean, if you could equate that relative -- it seems like you reserved for something worse than the base case.\nI mean, if you -- if we move to a base case, we're now seeing returns to kind of a normal. I mean, how much does that imply for potential reserve release relative to what you had at year-end?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I mean, Brian, I think as you sort of think about the reserve levels, I think for anybody, given the way the accounting standard works, you're not necessarily reserved just for a base case, right? You reserved for a whole number of scenarios that could potentially play out that are far worse potentially than a base case scenario. And so that's kind of where we are today. As you sort of look forward, the -- I think as we sort of see the path of the recovery, I think we're hopeful that all the stimulus and support that the government has been putting in, in it's many different ways and the potential for more of that should help provide a good bridge to the other side. But as -- and as Charlie said, I think if that's the case, I think we are -- we feel that we're very conservatively accrued for that kind of positive outcome.\nBut I think -- and we'll see how it plays out over the next couple of quarters.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd the only thing I'd add, I mean, it's just when you wind up quarter over quarter, our allowance to loans is -- as a percentage basis is the same. And we sit here today and we say the performance continues to be better than expected, which would suggest we feel even better about the level of reserving. But again, we're just -- given the unknowns, we think it's a good position to be in and a prudent thing to do, but we certainly feel better off quarter by quarter.\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nOK. And then, just a separate question on those selected efficiency initiatives that you outlined on Slide 18. Could you just kind of walk through which ones are the biggest impact to the overall expense savings? I know you had five different ones kind of summarized there, but what's like the number one, two with regards to potential expense saves?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Yeah. I would bring it back to Page 17 in the presentation. On the right-hand side, we've dimensioned the percentage that each of the categories contribute to the $8 billion, Brian.\nSo I think that will probably give you a good sense of where the most impact is coming from. And really, the things that we're doing across the company in terms of really streamlining the structure and finding ways to optimize are the biggest single piece, but it impacts many of -- most groups across the company. And then, as you sort of look at the other categories, it's a -- they're somewhat comparable relative -- on a relative basis in terms of their contribution. So you can see what that looks like.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nHi, guys. One nitpicky question and one bigger picture. First one on the nitpicky, when we look at that path to the 10% short-term ROTCE, using the fourth quarter as a base, you, obviously, had a very low tax rate. I think it's about 3%.\nAnd if we strip out the reserve release, it's about 25 basis points of charge-offs. So that 10% kind of ROTCE in the short term, whenever that is, is that kind of dependent on still unusually low tax rate and reserve release? Or is that really driven by the incremental expenses beyond what you've laid out and obviously, the capital, too?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No, it's a good question. Look, as we sort of look forward, I think the -- as you think about the different components of what you walked through, I think the -- as we said it for 2021, the tax rate is going to be sort of in mid-single digits. And so you get a sense of how we think, how sustainable that is for a little while.\nAnd really, the big drivers here, though, are going to be driving the expense down as we sort of outlined and really getting the annualized benefits from all the stuff we're doing today and the stuff that will have more impact in 2022. And then, obviously, we've got the restrictions lifted on the buyback. So I wouldn't over-index on sort of the one-timers that you see in the quarter because the reserve releases are offset by some of the restructuring charges and other things that you sort of look that are embedded in that 8%.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd Brian -- sorry, Matt. I guess -- it's Charlie. The only thing I would add on that -- yes, sorry. The only thing I would add is just being very practical about it is, as Mike said, I think there are lots of pluses and minuses.\nWe could go through each of them, we think -- and we do think it is a reasonable starting point. But the thing I would add is we, obviously, at this point, have really detailed plans as we look into 2021 by quarter and for the full year and do feel very good about that as a starting point.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. And then, the bigger-picture question, and there's probably no super tactful way to ask this. But you've assumed, at least here for the targets and guidance, no lifting of the asset cap this year. And it seemed like that was being telegraphed by some of the media articles in recent months.\nBut I guess, if we do kind of look out a year from now and the asset cap hasn't been lifted, would that be disappointing to you, Charlie? And I appreciate that it will be a little over two years you've been here. But at the same time, it takes time to build a management team, and there's been COVID, which your firm and the banks in general have done a lot of things for employees, a lot of things for customers, and that can be distracting. So I know there's some puts and takes, but a lot of us on kind of the investor and sell side, obviously, look at the asset cap being in place for quite some time. And I'm sure you're impatient and we are all impatient, too.\nSo how would you feel a year from now if it's still here?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, Matt. Listen, It's a very, very tactful way of asking the question of when we think the asset cap will be lifted, which you know that I'm not in a position to answer. And so I think your sentiments are right about what it takes, it takes time. It takes a management team.\nI think what I'll say, if you look at the remarks that we made in the prepared part of the call, the words are very carefully chosen. And so we do believe that we're making progress. As I -- even more broadly, I feel great about the team we have in place, our understanding of what has to get done for this consent order and for the others. As I said, I made the statement that I do believe that we're making progress.\nBut if you look at the words that are required in the consent order, they're really clear, which is execute and implement that, and we've got significant work to do. And I can't share with you -- I wish -- I believe and I understand why you're asking. I said this last quarter, too. I really do.\nI wish I could share with you the specifics of what the plan is. I can't do that. And ultimately, it's up to the FRB anyway. So I really -- I'm just not in a position to put the time frame around it other than I feel very confident that we know what has to get done and we're moving forward.\nAnd I wish I could be more specific than that.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nCharlie, sorry to hop right back to the asset cap. But one more thing on that. I wanted to see if you can let us know. I know part of that process is the third-party review.\nAre you able to let us know if you will get at that stage of the third-party review for the consent order that includes the asset cap?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI really can't. I'm just -- again, we're not in a position because of CSI to be able to talk about where we stand, the progress, where we are along that continuum. Again, I just -- I'd go back. I wish I could say more.\nI go back to the words. I do believe that we are making progress. As I said, it's really clear what we have to do. I think we have people that don't just understand what needs to be done but are capable of adopting and implementing, which is what's required for the third-party review once -- at the point at which the Fed ultimately accepts the -- or just chooses to accept.\nAnd that's really all I could say at this point.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nNo, that's helpful. All right. Thank you. And then, separately, on the expense front, the $8 billion in cost saves, does that already reflect the real estate rationalization, the 15% to 20% reduction that you mentioned? I know you cited on the slide around the expense efforts, but I'm not sure.\nDoes it reflect that whole rationalization? Because that's a fairly substantial cut to your real estate footprint.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. The bulk of it is included in the $8 billion number that we gave you, so.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you. One more thing on that. Regarding the cadence of the remaining $4.3 billion of that $8 billion beyond 2021, I know you indicated to be over several years, is that still going to be more front-end-loaded? Meaning could the savings realized in 2022 be higher than what will be realized in 2023? Is that how we should think about it?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think we'll give you better guidance on 2022 as we get toward the end of the year. But it's something, as you -- it's something that will take a few years to sort of work our way through that list. And as Charlie said, we're not done. There's a long list of other items that are being vetted as we speak that sort of add to that list, so.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd let me just add to it, just so we're not trying to be coy in any way, shape or form. What we're trying to do is do what we said we would do, which is we said last quarter that we would give you what we thought was our clearest line of sight to our expenses for 2021, which is what we've done. As we look beyond that, we do believe there are significant additional gross cost saves to take out. But we're also making sure that we've got the ability as we go through the year to understand what continuing investments need to get made, which include doing everything that we need to do on the risk and regulatory front.\nSo we don't want to give a net number and box ourselves in and then believe we need to spend a different amount on the risk and regulatory stuff because that's going to be what it ever needs -- what it needs to be. And so what the prepared remarks laid out was the gross saves are significant. We expect to -- what we are targeting is to continue to show net reductions year over year. So we continue on this path to increasing efficiency, acknowledging that we're not giving you the specificity beyond 2021 at this point.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. That's helpful. All right. Thank you.\nOperator\nYou next question comes from the line of David Long with Raymond James.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGood morning, everyone.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nCharlie, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that the bank's No. 1 focus is building the right management team. Obviously, a lot of changes near the top and in your top operating team for the last 15 months since you've been CEO. Are there still additional changes needed on that team? And any specific positions that you would still like to fill?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Well, so just -- first of all, our No. 1 priority is getting the risk and regulatory work done, which will ultimately resolve these consent orders that we have. The management -- building the management team is one of the key enablers in getting there.\nYeah, listen, I feel great about the management team that we have. I think that this is -- these are always -- it is always an ongoing process where we're always looking at -- once one level gets filled, everyone is looking to make sure that they've got the right members of the team behind them. And there's no question that with all of the talent we brought in from the outside, given where we are, that enables us to leverage more of the talent inside the company and put them in the right roles. So I don't foresee these -- the pace and the dramatic changes that we've made.\nI think most of that is done at this point, and then it's just continuing to build the lower levels and recognizing that there are always some changes that happen here and there for different reasons.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGot it. I appreciate the color. And then, the -- you talked about additional costs still needed to improve the operations and your investments in 2021 to get out of all the remaining consent orders. Where do you still think you need to spend Do you have any areas earmarked at this point?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I mean, so when we look at that -- what page is it? It's the page -- is it 19? That shows the -- where we break out from the $54 billion going to $53 billion. And then, we break out the net $1.5 billion reduction, we show you the gross versus the investments. Embedded in that $1.6 billion is a series of things.\nRoughly a third of it or so are specific adds that we're doing to continue the work on building out the risk and control infrastructure. Those are everything from continued adds in compliance, independent risk and all the functions that are necessary to, for the most part, build the operational and compliance infrastructure that's required in Fed and OCC consent orders but is the right foundational work to do. We have a series of increases embedded in there, which are investments in technology. Some of the expenses relate to things we need to build to get the efficiencies out.\nBut we also have some net increases there, also to continue building out some product capabilities and things like that. So I'll just point you back to that $1.6 billion is on a gross basis, what's embedded in our numbers this year, 2021 that is.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGot it. Appreciate the color. Thanks for taking my question.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Operator? Operator, are you there? Uh-oh. Hold on, everyone. Give us a minute.\nJohn Campbell, are you working on this?\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you, and good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGerard, Gerard, better be a good one, given the anticipation.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nHere you go. I thought maybe you guys on your expense savings, you only paid for 90 minutes, and they cut you off short or something, so -- but anyway, thank you for taking the question. Maybe, Mike, I know the net servicing income is always volatile quarter to quarter. Can you share with us the -- what went on with hedging this quarter? Obviously, it was a negative number.\nBut again, I know it's volatile quarter to quarter.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Sure. And Gerard, I may take you up on that idea, by the way, of limiting the call maybe next quarter. Look, I think as you sort of look at the MSR asset.\nObviously, there's a bunch of things that sort of impact what's happening, which sort of drives the servicing income in there. And I think a couple of things you saw was the higher prepays and sort of the velocity in the mortgage market impacting that. And then, you also saw servicing cost as modeled. So as you probably know, with these assets, like you're modeling your future costs, which then reduces or increases your income in the current period.\nAnd you look at the -- that servicing income going up a little bit as you sort of look at the cost that you might have to incur given some of the forbearance programs and the extensions of those. And so there wasn't anything outside of those items that was really driving the result.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. And then, as a follow-up, and I understand about the asset cap and the balance sheet. But in your net interest income expectations in Slide 16, what kind of interest rate environment would you need to see for the drag that you give us in that slide for that to go away? If you had your druthers, if you could paint the interest rate environment, the sensitivity analysis I'm assuming you guys do, what would we need to see for that to disappear?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Look, as I said earlier, to get to the top end of that range, we are using sort of the implicit, the implied forward curve as it stands over the last week or so. And so I think as you think about all else equal, any steepening from here or just overall increase from here, I think, would be helpful and additive to that.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd you have time for one more question, and that question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHi. Thank you for taking my question. And Charlie, thank you for your patience on this long call. I just wanted to get back to the question on gross versus net.\nAnd I wanted to get clarity on the $1.6 billion of investment spend. I think earlier in the call, you mentioned that it was still mostly related to risk and regulatory-related work. And as we go forward and we think about the potential for a higher ratio of net versus gross, how should we think about offensive, more offensive type of expense of investment? I think one of your peers today laid out $2.4 billion in investment spend, and $900 million of which was related to tech.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So just to be clear because I don't want to -- of the $1.6 billion that's in the investment line, again, roughly a third of that is very clearly the risk and control build-out. But the reality is there could be other things that we're doing that's in the remainder. Another big chunk of what's in that increase are things that we're doing to drive efficiency in the company.\nAnd then, there are, obviously, things that we're doing to build the future of the business. To your question of how to think about gross and net and the level of investments for the future, I think that is -- quite frankly, that's one of the reasons why we're just being very careful not to commit to anything beyond 2021. For 2021, we've been very, very thoughtful about what we believe we need to do, what we want to do and what do we actually have the capacity to do. And that's what's reflected in these numbers here.\nWe've hired a series of new people, both from the business side as well Ather as on the digital side. And as we think through what the expense base could be in '22 and beyond, we don't know at this point what we want that increase to be, which, over time, hopefully becomes more about building products and services that can be more effectively in the marketplace. And so I'm not sure, again, how to answer the question other than we expect to be doing that. We do have some of it embedded in the numbers today.\nBut we want to make sure that we understand what we might want to do. At the same time, that we are saying we believe, based on everything we know today, that we still should be able to do that and drive the expense base down on a net basis, just not sure what the net number is sitting here today.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you for taking my question.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nOf course.\nOperator\nAnd your last question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja from JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks for squeezing me in. I'll be -- so a quick one firstly to start with, which is expense reduction. That's -- Charlie, Mike, sorry, I jumped over and didn't go with the pleasantries of saying hello because I know you're squeezing me in.\nYou said revenue digits down low single digits from the business exits. How about expense reduction?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Yeah, Vivek, we'll give you more color as we sort of announce those and we get to the closing of some of those transactions. But it's probably not that different, I think, relative to the revenue contribution.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase -- Analyst\nOK. And then, Charlie, since this is the only opportunity we have to talk to you, I have a question strategically just to understand since you are making a lot of changes. Three areas, firstly, CRE. Since you are the biggest player, have been, what are you thinking there in terms of outlook for that business, including your U.K.\ncommercial real estate mortgage banking? Since you've cut back disclosure, is that a sign that you're pulling that back a little? And lastly, Charlie, also your outlook for trading since assets are down sharply year on year or your plans for trading?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Listen, CRE, I mean, as you can see in our disclosures, is an extremely important business for us. We think we have a great franchise, which is made up of -- it's the customer base, but it's also the people that we have. We're not -- our portfolio is not immune to losses that will inevitably be taken because of this environment, separate that out from we believe that we are hopefully more than appropriately reserve for that, but time will tell.\nThe devil is in the detail when you talk about commercial real estate in terms of -- it's a very broad caption. But when you look at who you're lending to, what the structures are, obviously, a big difference between hotels, retail, office space, the level of security you have. And so I -- we continue to believe that done properly, it will continue to be a really important part of what we do. And we've got a team that reacts appropriately and actions they've taken certainly going even into COVID will serve us well.\nTrading, listen. I think, as I said before, Vivek, I think you're expanding the impact a little bit. I think there's no question that when we look at our corporate investment bank in addition to our commercial bank, when we've asked people to take actions to reduce balance sheet, that's a place where we've gone. And it's true on the deposit side, but it's also true on the trading side as well, both in terms of customer financing, as well as trading assets where possible.\nAgain, I would say the same thing here. I think our customers understand what we're doing and why we're doing it. They understand the position that we're in. And I think when we've looked at where we've had to make reductions, it's been with an eye toward when the asset cap does eventually go away, and we have a latitude to continue building as we were building in the past.\nWe would expect to see more resources put there, certainly to bring us back in line where we were and then to build the business like we want to build the rest of our businesses at Wells.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase -- Analyst\nOK. Great. One last one was mortgage banking. Charlie, any color on that? Your plans for that? Obviously, you've been a leading player.\nIt's a much bigger piece for you than the other G-SIFIs. What's your thinking on that? You've cut back on correspondent. What are you thinking as you look ahead given that you've cut back? This is just making me wonder.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo, listen, I think it's -- home lending is a really important business for us to be in. I don't -- when we look at what we want to do to serve consumers across Wells Fargo, the home lending -- but when I say consumers, I mean, both in our consumer and small business bank, as well as customers that they deal with directly through their own channels, as well as our wealth segment. Home lending products are extremely important to that relationship. We've got a great team there.\nAs you know, Mike Weinbach runs all of home lending. Kristy Fercho joined us as the CEO of our home lending business. And I think for us, it's going to be going to that next level of detail. which is really understanding on the origination side by channel what does profitability look like, how do we continue to drive more profitability, how do we compete more effectively in digital originations where the banks generally have not done a great job versus what others have done.\nAnd on the service -- excuse me, on the servicing side, being more thoughtful probably than we've been about portfolio by portfolio, what are the servicing economics, where do we think it makes sense for us to service, where does it not make sense for us to service. And so I think what you'll see is us becoming -- putting a finer point on what that looks like from a service perspective and driving more profitability on the origination side, but it's important for us.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK. Listen, thank you very much. Certainly, we appreciate all the time that you've put in, not just on this call. But we know the revised disclosures create a bunch of work for you all.\nBut hopefully, it helps us have a better conversation going forward as we talk about what the future of the company is. And as I said, I think we've got a lot of work still to do. I believe we are making great progress. And when these headwinds abate and the actions that we're taking are reflected in our performance, I continue to feel really good about what the opportunity holds for us.\nSo thanks again for the time, and look forward to talking to you some more. Take care.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 98 minutes\nCall participants:\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase -- Analyst\nMore WFC analysis\nAll earnings call transcripts"}
{"date": "Apr 14, 2022, 10:00 a.m. ET", "exchange": "NYSE: WFC", "q": "2022-Q1", "ticker": "WFC", "transcript": "Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nWelcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo first quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nThanks, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie. \nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results, the operating environment, and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review the first quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start off with some first quarter highlights.\nWe earned $3.7 billion or $0.88 per common share in the first quarter. Our results included $0.21 per share impact from a decrease in the allowance for credit losses. We have broad-based loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the fourth quarter. While net interest income was down modestly from the fourth quarter, driven by fewer days in the quarter, it grew 5% from a year ago.\nHigher interest rates, along with our expectations for continued loan growth should drive higher net interest income growth that we anticipated at the beginning of the year. Mike will provide more details regarding our current view later on in the call. However, the increase in rates negatively impacted our mortgage banking business. The mortgage origination market experienced one of its largest quarterly declines that I can remember and it will take time for the industry to reduce excess capacity.\nCredit performance remained incredibly strong, and our net charge-off ratio declined to 14 basis points. While we have minimal direct exposure to Russia or Ukraine, we're monitoring certain industries that have the potential to be impacted by the conflict and economic sanctions, but thus far don't have concerns. In addition, we returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter, including repurchasing $6 billion of common stock and increasing our common stock dividend to $0.25 per share. The significant changes we've made across the company have put us in a position to increase the dividend and our work continues.\nThe health of our consumer and businesses so far has remained strong, though we're entering a period of uncertainty. March was the eighth straight month in which inflation outpaced income with lower-income consumers being most impacted by rising energy and food prices. That said, higher deposit balances and rising wages have thus far allowed consumers to weather these headwinds. We continued to see median deposit balances above pre-pandemic levels, up approximately 25% compared to 2020 but down from the highs observed in 2021.\nConsumer credit card spend remained strong, up 33% from a year ago. All spending categories were up with the highest growth in travel, entertainment, fuel, and dining. After strong growth in the first quarter of 2021, driven by stimulus payments, debit card spending increased 6% in the first quarter of 2022. Discretionary spending remained strong with entertainment up 39% and travel up 29% from a year ago.\nThe increase in energy prices was reflected in a 27% increase in fuel spending. Loan demand from our commercial customers increased with growth in both commitments and loans outstanding as customers' borrowing needs are increasing to fund working capital expansion. Credit quality remained strong with net recoveries in our commercial portfolio. Now let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities.\nBuilding an appropriate risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and I continue to believe that we're making significant progress. Early in the first quarter, we named Derek Flowers, our new chief risk officer, following Mandy Norton's retirement announcement. Derek has extensive experience managing risk including the work he's done over the last several years of managing the build-out of Wells Fargo's risk and control framework. Derek has been with Wells Fargo for over 20 years and his familiarity with the company and its risk background make him the ideal candidate to succeed Mandy, who I'd like to thank for the tremendous progress she made in transforming the risk organization.\nWe also continue to make progress in resolving legacy regulatory issues with news in January that the OCC had terminated a consent order regarding add-on products that the company sold to retail banking customers before 2015. We have much more work to do to satisfy our regulatory requirements, and we will likely have setbacks, but I'm confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years. We remain focused on improving our financial performance while investing to drive growth across our businesses. Providing our customers with simple, easy-to-use, and fast digital experiences is one of our most important strategic priorities.\nIn the first quarter, we began rolling out our new mobile banking experience for our customers in our consumer businesses, and feedback has been very positive. Digital adoption, which is critical to both delivering seamless digital experiences that our customers expect and reducing the cost to serve has continued to increase with mobile active customers up 4% from a year ago. We added approximately 500,000 new mobile active customers in the first quarter alone. We continue to invest to improve our digital capabilities with additional enhancements planned for this year.\nWe're also focused on reducing friction and moving money. We've continued to invest in Zelle and made changes to expand customer usage, including increasing sending limits. These changes have helped to drive 21% growth in active send customers and a 33% increase in send volume from a year ago. We continued to enhance our credit card offerings with our partnership with Bilt Rewards and MasterCard.\nThis first-of-its-kind co-brand card allows members to pay rent and earn points with no transaction fees on rent payments at any apartment in the U.S. In the first quarter, we selected nCino to streamline our origination, underwriting, and portfolio management for our small business customers. This collaboration is expected to provide our customers with a more streamlined lending experience and builds on our existing relationship that we announced last year to accelerate our digital transformation within our commercial banking and corporate investment banking businesses. Let me just make some summary comments before I turn it over to Mike.\nAs we sit here today, our internal indicators continue to point toward the strength of our customers' financial position but the Federal Reserve has made it clear that it will take actions necessary to reduce inflation and this will certainly reduce economic growth. In addition, the war in Ukraine adds additional risk to the downside. Wells Fargo is positioned well to provide support for our clients in a slowing economy. While we will likely see an increase in credit losses from historical lows, we should be a net beneficiary as we will also benefit from rising rates.\nWe have a strong capital position and our lower expense base creates greater margins from which to invest. We remain diligent in extending credit and are focusing on managing the other risk types within the company as well. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past on a run rate basis at some point this year. We continue to focus on a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions.\nAs we have all seen, the reports and images coming out of Ukraine are deeply concerning. In order to support those most impacted, we announced $1 million in donations across three nonprofits in support of humanitarian aid for Ukraine and Ukrainian refugees as well as services that support the U.S. military. Earlier this week, we also announced plans to introduce HOPE Inside centers in select branches to increase access to financial education and guidance.\nWorking with Operation HOPE is one important way that we can remove barriers to financial inclusion as part of our banking inclusion initiative, which is focused on helping more people who are unbanked gain access to affordable mainstream banking products. Since the pandemic began, close to 100,000 of our employees never left the workplace. And last month, we started to welcome the rest back to the office. It's been great to be back together again, and I want to thank all of our employees as they work together to better serve our customers, our communities, and each other.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.7 billion or $0.88 per common share, and our results included a $1.1 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses, predominantly due to reduced uncertainty around the economic impact of COVID on our loan portfolios. Our effective income tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 16%, which included net discrete income tax benefits due to stock-based compensation. We expect our effective income tax rate for the full year to be approximately 18%, excluding any additional discrete items.\nOur CET1 ratio declined to 10.5%, still well above our regulatory minimum of 9.1%. We highlight capital on Slide 3. The decrease in our CET1 ratio from the fourth quarter reflected a $5.1 billion reduction in cumulative other comprehensive income, driven by higher interest rates and wider agency MBS spreads, which reduced the ratio by approximately 40 basis points. Higher risk-weighted assets driven by growth in loan balances and commitments.\nWe adopted the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk, which had a minimal impact on total risk-weighted assets, and we continued with our strong capital returns. We repurchased $6 billion of common stock in the first quarter, bringing our total repurchases since the third quarter of 2021 to $18.3 billion, which is in line with our 2021 capital plan. While we have flexibility under the stress capital buffer framework to exceed the share repurchases contemplated in our capital plan, we will be disciplined in our approach, given the current rate volatility and currently expect to have significantly lower levels of share buybacks in the second quarter. Finally, we've submitted our 2022 capital plan.\nAnd as I've called out before, it's possible that our stress capital buffer could increase when the Federal Reserve publishes our official stress capital buffer in the third quarter, while our GSIB surcharge of 1.5% will remain the same for 2023. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our net loan charge-off ratio declined to 14 basis points in the first quarter. Commercial credit performance was strong again with $29 million of net recoveries in the first quarter driven by recoveries in energy, asset-based lending and middle market.\nConsumer credit performance was also strong. Credit losses were down $59 million from the fourth quarter, which included $152 million of net charge-offs related to a change in practice to fully charge off certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans. The first quarter included higher auto losses and seasonally higher credit card losses. Nonperforming assets decreased $323 million or 4% from the fourth quarter.\nCommercial nonaccruals were down $423 million, declining again this quarter and are now below pre-pandemic levels. Consumer nonaccruals increased $82 million driven by an increase in residential mortgage nonaccruals and primarily resulting from certain customers exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Overall, early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have exceeded our expectations. Our allowance for credit losses at the end of the first quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, less uncertainty around the economic impact of COVID, the economic recovery thus far and an outlook that reflects the increasing risks from high inflation in the Russian-Ukraine conflict.\nOn Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 3% from a year ago in the fourth quarter. Period-end loans grew for the third consecutive quarter and were up 6% from a year ago, with growth in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing business segment results.\nAverage deposits increased $70.6 billion or 5% from a year ago, with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking, partially offset by continued declines in corporate and investment banking and corporate treasury reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Turning to net interest income on Slide 7. First quarter net interest income increased $413 million or 5% from a year ago and declined $41 million from the fourth quarter. The decline from the fourth quarter was driven by $178 million of lower income from EPBO and paycheck protection program loans as well as two fewer days in the quarter, which offset the impact of higher earning asset yields and higher securities and loan balances.\nLast quarter, we highlighted that net interest income for full year 2022 could potentially increase by approximately 8% driven by loan growth and other balance sheet mix changes as well as the benefit from rising rates, which was based on the forward curve at that time. Obviously, a lot has changed over the past three months. Loan growth has been solid and average loan balances were up 3% versus the fourth quarter and 2% at period end. If we continue to see increased demand, it's possible that average loan balances will be up in the mid-single digits from the fourth quarter 2021 to fourth quarter 2022, up from our prior outlook earlier this year of low to mid-single digits.\nThe rate increase is currently included in the forward rate curve would also drive stronger net interest income growth than we anticipated earlier in the year. However, it's important to note that the benefit from rising rates is not linear, and we would expect deposit betas to accelerate after the initial rate hikes and customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products would also likely increase. Higher rates will also have a negative impact on mortgage volumes and potentially on market-related fees in corporate and investment banking, private equity and venture capital businesses and in wealth management. Given our current expectations for higher loan growth and recent forward rate curves, net interest income for full year 2022 could be up mid-teens on a percentage basis from 2021.\nThat said, net interest income growth will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas, and loan growth. Now turning to expenses on Slide 8. Noninterest expense declined 1% from a year ago. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives and expenses also declined due to divestitures last year.\nThe first quarter included approximately $600 million of seasonally higher personnel expenses, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement-eligible employees, and 401k matching contributions. We also had $673 million of operating losses, which were primarily driven by higher customer remediation expense predominantly for a variety of historical matters. Our full year 2022 expenses are still expected to be approximately $51.5 billion. However, as we experienced this quarter, operating losses can be episodic and hard to predict, and we will continue to update you on our expense expectations throughout the year.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 9. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to higher deposit balances, higher deposit-related fees, primarily reflecting lower fee waivers and an increase in debit card transactions. We continue to reduce the underlying cost to run the business and serve customers. Customers have continued to migrate to digital channels and correspondingly teller transactions are down 45% from pre-pandemic levels.\nOver the same period, we've decreased our number of branches by 12% and branch staffing by approximately 30%, and we have more opportunities to improve our efficiency while we continue to make enhancements to better serve customers. Earlier this year, we announced changes we are making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees. We began to implement some of these new policies and we'll be rolling out the rest of the changes this year. We eliminated fees for nonsufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions in early March.\nSo these changes didn't have a meaningful impact on the first quarter results. We still expect the annual decline in these fees to be approximately $700 million. However, as we highlighted last quarter, this is an annualized estimate and the reduction may be partially offset by higher levels of activity, and we will observe how customers respond to the new features that will be introduced in the latter part of the year. Home lending revenue declined 33% from a year ago and 19% from the fourth quarter, driven by lower mortgage originations and press margins given the higher rate environment and competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry.\nMortgage rates increased 156 basis points in the first quarter and are above rate levels observed for the most of the last -- for most of the last decade. Reflecting this environment, we expect second quarter originations and margins to remain under pressure and mortgage banking revenue to continue to decline. We've started to reduce expenses in response to the decline in volume and expect expenses will continue to decline throughout the year as excess capacity is removed and aligned to lower business activity. Credit card revenue was up 6% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and point-of-sale volumes.\nAuto revenue increased 10% and personal lending was up 2% from a year ago, primarily due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 10. Our mortgage originations declined 21% from the fourth quarter. We believe the mortgage market experienced its largest quarterly decline since 2003, primarily due to lower refinance activity in response to higher mortgage rates.\nHome lending loan balances grew modestly from the fourth quarter, driven by the third consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio, which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs. Turning to auto. Origination volume increased 4% from a year ago, but was down 22% from fourth quarter due to credit tightening in higher-risk segments and increased price competition as interest rates rose, and we targeted solid returns for new originations. Turning to debit card.\nTransactions declined 7% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality and were up 3% from a year ago with double-digit growth in travel and entertainment. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume continued to be strong, it was up 33% from a year ago, but down 5% from the fourth quarter due to seasonality. While payment rates remain elevated, balances grew 14% from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products. New credit card accounts increased over 80% from a year ago, and we continue to be pleased by the quality of the accounts we're attracting.\nTurning to commercial banking results on Slide 11. Middle market banking revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher deposit and loan balances as well as the impact of higher interest rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances, stronger net gains from equity securities, and higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Noninterest expense declined 6% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower personnel and occupancy expense due to efficiency initiatives and lower lease expense.\nAfter declining during the first half of last year, average loan balances have grown for three consecutive quarters and were up 6% from a year ago. Revolver utilization rates have increased but are still well below historical levels. Loan demand has been driven by larger clients who are increasing borrowing due to the impact of inflation on material and transportation costs as well as to support inventory growth. We're also seeing new demand from some clients who are catching up from underinvestment in projects and capital expenditures over the past couple of years.\nTurning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 12. Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher loan balances and improved treasury management results. Average loan balances were up 18% from a year ago with increased demand across most industries driven primarily by capital expenditures and growing working capital needs. Commercial real estate revenue grew 9% from a year ago, driven by the higher loan balances and higher revenue in our low-income housing business.\nAverage loan balances were up 17% from a year ago, and originations in the first quarter outpaced volumes from a year ago and loan pipelines continue to be strong. Markets revenue was down 18% from a year ago, primarily due to lower trading activity in residential mortgage-backed securities and high-yield products. Average deposits in corporate investment banking were down $25.3 billion or 13% from a year ago, driven by continued actions to manage into the asset cap. On Slide 13, wealth and investment management revenue grew 6% from a year ago, driven by higher asset-based fees on higher market valuations and higher net interest income from the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher deposit and loan balances.\nAs a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter. So first quarter results reflected market valuations as of Jan 1st, and second quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of April 1st. The 5% increase in expenses from a year ago was primarily driven by higher revenue-related compensation, which was more than offset by higher revenue. Average deposits were up 7% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending.\nSlide 14 highlights our corporate results, both revenue and expenses declined from a year ago, driven by the sale of our student loan portfolio and divestitures of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $791 million of revenue in the first quarter of 2021, including the gain on sale of our student loan portfolio and they accounted for approximately $400 million of the decline in expenses compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-down on the sale of our student loan portfolio. We will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. You may go ahead.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nThank you for taking the question. Mike, I appreciate the commentary on reiterating the expense guidance for the full year. I was just hoping, given sort of the lumpiness between the seasonality and the account expenses and then some of the operating losses. If you could maybe give a little bit more of a fine point on the trajectory.\nIn other words, how much could we -- or should we expect things to come down in the second quarter? And then is it going to be just a progressive decline through the end of the year? Or how will things ebb and flow in your mind?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Great. Thanks, Scott. As I said in the remarks, we had about $600 million of seasonal expenses in there related to 401k and stock comp and all the associated stuff in the first quarter.\nSo that starts to fall away. And then obviously, the other piece in there that I mentioned was operating losses, and that can be a little lumpy as you go throughout the year. But when you sort of take a step back, as you saw last year as well, as we execute our efficiency initiatives, you generally don't get all those benefits starting day one. And so you'll continue to get more and more impact throughout the year.\nSo you should expect the expense trajectory to be down as we go throughout the year. Now every quarter may not be down in a linear way, but nonetheless, you'll see a trend downward. And just to reinforce what we said in the remarks, we did -- we still believe the $51.5 billion for the full year is achievable despite the fact that we had the higher operating losses in the quarter. And then I'll just reiterate the other piece of guidance we gave on NII.\nWe do think -- as we said in January, we thought NII would be up about 8%. So we're almost doubling that to kind of the mid-teens as we look throughout the year, both given -- due to the loan growth we've seen and as well as the substantial move in rates.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nPerfect. Thank you. And then just maybe to follow up. I think you guys talked in the past about an expectation for expenses to decline next year as well.\nJust given how lasting some of these inflationary pressures seem to be, do you see any risk to that outlook of another down year in costs next year?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThis is Charlie. I would say a couple of things. I think it's still the way we think about the way we want to plan for the year, for sure, as we sit here today. On inflationary pressures, I would say, and it's still early and still thinking that things will still continue to evolve.\nBut our own experience here is that the wage pressures that we've seen today are not as great as they were in the fourth quarter of last year. So they still exist, but they do seem to be slowing. And obviously, the Fed is going to, as I said, going to do everything they can to bring that down. And so as we sit here today, by the time we get to the next year, I think we'll be in a very, very different position relative to where inflation is.\nAnd so we're still very focused on -- use the word efficiency, but we're really focused on running the place better. And that's what these expense reductions actually result in.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nAll right. Thank you guys very much.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. So wanted to just start off with a question on NII and excess liquidity deployment. Specifically, I was hoping you could speak to your appetite to deploy some of the excess liquidity that you guys still retain.\nAnd where reinvestment yields are currently just given spread widening in MBS in particular? And what securities you might look to purchase given some of the sensitivities on the duration side?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Thanks, Steve. It's Mike. Look, first, when it comes to deploying liquidity, it's going to be loans first, right? So if you think about the waterfall.\nAnd so as we see more loan growth, that's where it's going to go first. And obviously, that's the preferred path anyway. And then based on what we see there, we will decide if we're going to grow the securities portfolio throughout the year. I would say our -- the guidance we gave for NII does not assume that we grow the portfolio in any substantial way.\nAnd so that will -- we'll have to see how that goes based on what we see from a loan growth perspective. And then you can see where yields are across both treasuries and MBS, which are the two primary asset classes we have in the portfolio. And I think, obviously, we're now investing at higher rates than we've seen certainly in a while, and that's additive as we go forward.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nGot it. And just one follow-up relating to deposit beta specifically, certainly a big area of focus given the more aggressive pace of Fed tightening as well as QT, I was hoping you can just speak to your relative stickiness of your deposit base versus last cycle given the liability optimization, you guys have been executing under the asset cap for a number of years now. And is there a credible case in your view that deposit betas could in fact be lower this cycle just given some of that favorable deposit remixing?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No. I think you highlighted the right point. As you look at what we've had to do over the last couple of years, manage on the asset cap, we've really pushed away some of our most interest rate-sensitive deposits during that time.\nAnd so we've seen the least rate-sensitive deposits on the retail side and the consumer side grow as a percentage of the overall deposit base. And so that's definitely going to help lower the average betas that we'll see relative to what we saw in the last cycle. I think our expectations as you sort of think about the different slices of the deposit base haven't really changed much over the last couple of months. I think as we look at the first 100 basis points, we don't think deposit rates are going to move that much, which is pretty similar to what we saw last go around.\nAnd then I think on the consumer side, you'll have slower betas and you'll have higher betas on the wholesale side. But likely, given our position, we'll lag a little bit on pricing given the asset cap and what we've got to do to continue to manage that.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd this is Charles. The only thing I would add is that I think a lot of it also depends on what the other alternatives for folks that are out there certainly on the consumer side. And when you look at the environment that we're heading into and the volatility that we'll see, I just -- I think that's a very different kind of environment than if you're in a very stable market and rates are just moving up relatively slowly. So I think it is different in that respect as well.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nAll right. That's great. If I could just squeeze in one more quick one. Would just be remiss if I didn't ask about -- given some of the fee income commentary that you guys have highlighted, particularly some of the headwinds on both mortgage as well as wealth management, how we should be thinking about the right jumping-off point for 2Q fee income, just given a lot of volatility in a few of those line items in the quarter?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I'll give you a couple of points there. So as you think about the advisory assets, if you look at what's happened in both the fixed income and equity markets in terms of the valuation at the 3/31 being down, I think, roughly 5% or 6% is probably not a bad place to start the modeling on advisory assets, given the fact that a large chunk of them are built-in advance based on that value. On the mortgage business, we will see a step down given the pretty abrupt slowdown in the refinance market, in particular.\nWe still expect to have decent volumes in the purchase market, but spreads will definitely -- or gain on sale margins will definitely be impacted given there's still a lot of excess capacity in the system. Now I would just keep that in context of the backdrop that we laid out in terms of the growth and NII as you look through the rest of the year. So even if you start to see a little bit of pressure on those line items, the growth in NII will position us pretty well throughout the rest of the year.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. And this is Charlie. And the only -- I would just add to that. I think when you think about how we are -- and I kind of said this in the quote and in my remarks, the way we're positioned going into an environment like this is we feel very positive about where we stand.\nAnd mortgage banking income is going to decline because rates are going up, and we're going to make much more on the increase in rates than we will on the decline in mortgage banking income. We're continuing to focus on reducing expenses. Credit is still exceptionally good and certainly will be into the next quarter based on everything that we see and possibly beyond, even though at one point, they will go up. And so while we're not sure what the overall economic environment will look like, that doesn't change our point of view on the fact that we're well-positioned for.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nJust a reminder, I said in my script, Steve, too, on the impact of the reduction in nonsufficient fund balance fees and some of the overdraft changes we made, you'll start to see the impact of that in the second quarter as well.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. On the expense side, I appreciate you helping us out with the $51.5 billion in terms of the reiteration of the guide. On the operating loss side, how do you feel about that $1.3 billion expectation given the pressure on the number in the quarter? And then separately, I guess, also on the cost savings, I wanted to see how you're feeling about the $3.3 billion in gross saves and $1.6 billion net. Any changes to that expectation? Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo I'll just -- I'll take the first part and Mike, you maybe take the second. On the first one, the things that we saw in the first quarter are very specific to remediations. And so what we saw in the first quarter really has nothing to do with what we'll see in the next series of quarters. And so those kind of stand on their own and it's not something that gets built on from there.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And as you look at the efficiency, and I think hopefully, this was implied in what we -- the guidance we gave, but we're executing well on the efficiency program that we've got. And as I said a number of times over the last couple of quarters, it's not a -- it's not a static program like this is something that we're embedding in the DNA of how we run the place and it continues to evolve, and we feel good about executing on that.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. And then on the capital side, I know the CET1 decline of 90 basis points this quarter. You also mentioned the SCB surcharge could increase. You did flag a lower level of buyback expected for the second quarter.\nMaybe can you talk about your thoughts on capital return beyond the second quarter, just given how things are shaping up and your earnings outlook. I just wonder if you can get updated thoughts there. Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I'll start, Mike, and then you can chime in. I think what we're just trying to do is just -- it's -- we do have the reality of the impact on OCI during the quarter. And so you see where CET1 is.\nOur quarter -- our dividend is about $1 billion a quarter or so. So we do have plenty of room inside there for any other further changes to OCI or the ability for us to grow RWA, which we want to do as loan growth continues to show the demand that we're seeing. And so I think just where we are specifically in the second quarter will depend on where rates come out. And then beyond that, we'll still -- obviously, we're going through CCAR, but we still should have capacity to figure out what we want to do with the excess capital that the company generates.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And as earnings capacity grows, as NII grows and we go through the year and we execute on our efficiency program, there's -- and we're still operating under the asset cap. You -- there's -- I think you'll see us be prudent, but we've got plenty of flexibility as we look through the rest of the year.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. Great. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is now open, sir.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks. Good morning. Just a couple of follow-ups on the cost side.\nSo Mike, the business sales from last year and kind of the stranded costs and the transition agreements, can you walk us through again how much of that was in the first quarter? And then how does that kind of decline? And is that also built into your full year expectation for the cost numbers?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So what we said, Ken, as you look at the first quarter, is about $400 million of expenses fell away in the quarter as the business exited. And the remainder -- and so about $300 million of that was from the ongoing run rate of the businesses, about $100 million was a charge we took last year for the student loan business. But -- and the remainder falls either under the TSAs, which are in place today and likely run most of the year, if not into early next year.\nBut remember, there's revenue on the other side of that. And then you have the stranded costs. So the numbers we laid out at the end of the fourth quarter last year are -- haven't changed. And as the TSAs roll off, we'll do our best to highlight that if it's meaningful.\nAnd then we're going to continue to work on the stranded costs and get them out, but that will take a little bit of time as we said last quarter.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nRight. OK. And then just two little things on net interest income. You did mention that you had the EPBO sales this quarter and I think related lower net interest income plus you did show the decline in premium am.\nI'm wondering if you can just help us understand how much the EPBO sales took out of NII? And are you still expecting those to go out through the year? And then how do you expect premium am to trend from here? Thanks, Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And the combo of PPP loans and EPBOs came down sequentially or linked quarter about $178 million, and that was the impact on revenue there on NII. And so -- and we'll reiterate that in the Q when it comes out. As you look at premium am or for mortgage backed, you can look at the slide for reference when you have time.\nI know it's a busy day today, but it came down roughly a little over $100 million, $110 million, $15 million decline in the quarter. And that will continue to decline as prepay slow throughout the year. So it's come down quite a bit since where we were last year.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHi, Mike. Just on the fee income front, you made a couple of comments already about the core fee lines. What about some of the more volatile lines on the capital markets side? I think the venture capital came in a little bit better than expected in a tough market this quarter. What should we be thinking about in terms of investment banking, trading, and maybe the Norwest Venture line?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. As you know, predicting investment banking fees and market fees is fraught with lots of issues. But I think, look, the -- it's clear that on the investment banking side, some of the capital markets, particularly on the equity side, has slowed quite a bit this year given some of the volatility we've seen. Our pipeline really hasn't change much.\nIt's still pretty strong from where we stand coming into the quarter. And so some of that realization of that pipeline is just somewhat market-dependent and dependent on some deals, timing of some of the deals closing. So we'll see. The market's revenue is somewhat dependent on the volatility that we see and the demand we see.\nAnd so I think as others have gone through this, we'll benefit from some of that as we go through it. But that's hard to predict exactly where we'll end up. And then on Norwest Venture, if you go back a number of years and you look at there's some number -- there's some like stability to that line when you look at over the last three or four years. I think when you look at some of what happened this quarter, we did have a bunch of realized, like business being sold or going public in one or two cases of some of the investments.\nAnd so that was really good to see that, that's still continuing despite some of the market volatility. And I think we'll see how it goes. I think we won't -- it's hard to imagine we'll see some of the peaks that we saw last year in that revenue line item. But I do expect we'll continue to see some good performance across those businesses.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks. And also on the NII, any comments you could make about your expectations for the cadence of the NII improvement throughout the year and maybe a little bit of what you're baking in on premium am and maybe how much benefit you get from -- on a spot basis, like a hike of 25 or 50 bps. Just any framework there? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No. So a lot of it's going to be dependent on how fast the Fed moves. And as you know, when the Fed moves, the impact of that is immediate, you start realizing that the day after.\nAnd so obviously, the expectations there have changed quite a bit. So that will be the case. I think in the Q, we give you the shock numbers on 100 basis point moves. And those are pretty close to what you should expect for the first few rate rises in terms of the impact.\nAnd again, it's pretty immediate for the most of it.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nAnd the premium am, Mike, you assume that that comes down throughout the year?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. It has to, yeah, I mean, absolutely. It will continue to come down as we see rates go up and prepay slow, sorry about that. But yes, I think you'll start to see that come down.\nWill it -- I think it will be -- it's a little bit dependent upon again how things progress, but it's not unreasonable to think as we look at the next quarter that it's somewhere in the ballpark of what we saw from -- on a linked quarter basis this quarter.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nGot it. I guess I was wondering, did you improve the assumptions for that? Is that part of the NII upgrade? Or is that more just rates kind of -- OK.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. That's baked into the increase in NII that we gave, John.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGood morning. I guess first question, Charlie, you've, in the past, talked about the 15% ROTCE as needing the asset capital lift and some level of higher rates. We're getting a lot more in terms of higher rates than we expected six months ago. Just doing rough math in terms of how you've talked about expense outlook, mid-teens NII growth.\nDo you think it's conceivable that we hit 15% ROTCE at some point over the next four to six quarters, even without the asset cap being lifted?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI don't want to talk about a time frame yet because I think what we've consistently said and will stick to that is we'll get to 10%, and then we'll talk a little bit more about the 15% and try and hone a little bit more on timing. But I do think it is fair to assume that the rate rises that we're seeing are more than we would have thought was necessary to get to 15%. But so I think the question of the asset cap not still being with us. I think that's just -- that is the reality.\nAnd so it's quite possible that the rate rises will be more of a benefit than we would have hoped in terms of offsetting that. But I just can't I think we should just wait until we get to 10%. But certainly, these rate rises that we're seeing and the asset sensitivity that we have are certainly a meaningful positive for us and more than we would have expected.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nI appreciate that response. And just one quick question on credit, Mike. When we think about another quarter of sizable reserve release, we've seen one of your peers yesterday built reserves, talking about just putting a higher weight on a stress case scenario. Give us a sense in terms of your outlook for the economy and how that leads to loan losses where they are today versus, I think your day one CECL was about 95 basis points.\nJust any thought process around how you're thinking through that would be helpful.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThis is Charles. I'll take a stab at it first. I think it's -- I think understanding what's in our CECL assumptions is something which is important, as hard as it is to predict. It does give you a sense for how we're thinking about things and how our loan book and other items play out in that reserving calculation.\nBut it is very hard to compare across companies because we have different scenarios. We put different profitabilities on different things. And the way the conservatism in models is different across companies. I think what we've seen consistently in our reserving levels as we've been on the more conservative side relative to others.\nThat might just be a view of a more conservative set of assumptions or something which is embedded in our models or the way we think about just the potential impacts of COVID and now the potential impacts of a slowing economy. So I would say, overall, I don't -- sitting here today, if you were to look at our -- the way we look at the assumptions that go into it, I think we were already assuming a reasonable percentage of probability on the downside. And so that hasn't changed but we feel better about some of the assumptions we made relative to COVID, and we've added some assumptions relative to inflation. So I think net-net-net, that's what drives the reduction in terms of where we are.\nAnd I still think we're -- we feel very comfortable and hopefully are at the more conservative end of what can come out of a CECL calculation.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. And should we then still assume that the reserves probably track lower over the next few quarters, at least absent a big change in the macro?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I think it's all dependent on macro at this point. CECL requires you to take a look at based upon what the full amount of the losses embedded in the portfolio relative to what you see as the macroeconomic outlook and the specific performance. So if our outlook gets better, reserves will come down.\nIf it gets worse, we'll go up. And if it stays the same, it will be along there.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. I had another semi-technical question here. But on the NII outlook, I get your point that you should see improvement pretty near term from the rate environment.\nI'm just thinking about what you put in your release for the yields on loans where at least this quarter, loan yields came down a bit. Now I know part of that's probably day count, but we saw some declines in resi mortgage on first and second lien and also on the auto side. And I just wanted to get a sense -- and also in C&I, right? So I just wanted to get a sense what was playing into that Q-on-Q? And then how quickly that could revert as we go through this year?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Betsy, it's Mike. I'll try to take a shot at that. I think on the resi mortgage side, what you're seeing is the impact of the EPBO loans and so they're coming -- the impacted of those coming down.\nSo that creates a little bit of noise, I think, relative to the yield there. If you look at the rest of the -- on the C&I book, I'm going to get the directionally the percentage. But it's, call it, two-thirds of the C&I book in that neighborhood is floating rate, maybe plus or minus a little bit there. But the -- and so that starts to react pretty obviously, direct pretty quickly to rates moving.\nAnd any given quarter, you see a little bit of noise on that yield, but you'll start to see that react as rates go up.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. It's not like it's hedged out, and that's why we saw what we saw Q-on-Q?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. And then the other message I'm getting from you this morning is that this rate improvement you're expecting to drop to the bottom line? Is that fair?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think we reiterated our expense guidance for the year, and NII is going to be a lot better.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nBetsy, what's in your question? I'm not sure I understand.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nWell, you're getting an uptick in rates. And given the fact that your guidance on expenses is holding steady, it seems like you're going to drop all that rate hike to the bottom line.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I mean, yes, we're going to make more money on NII. We -- Mike went through the specifics on how noninterest income will likely come down, but not -- obviously not nearly as much as the benefit that we'll get as you look out over NII. And charge-offs still will remain at low levels for the foreseeable future, even though those will go up at some point. And yes, expenses will continue to come down for us to meet the 51.5 number.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes. I mean it feels like it's at least a mid-singles uptick on consensus EPS. That's what it feels like to me at least. But I mean I know if you drop all the NII to the bottom line, I get something closer to high-singles uptick on consensus EPS, but --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI'll just make sure you look at -- I mean, I try to layout a little bit of what's going to happen on noninterest income. I think charge-offs are at all-time lows. You see the delinquency numbers. So unless there's something on the commercial side or the wholesale side that we're not aware of.\nIt's -- we feel -- it's one of -- when we talk about how we feel, I think it's -- the economy is the economy. We are positioned well for this kind of environment. But we also think people should just make sure that they're conscious of the movement in all the line items.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nAnd then on the customer remediation charge that you took this quarter, I guess that's the other kind of question that I've been getting is, it's one timey, but it feels like it's happened a lot. So how much more is left?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt's really hard to answer, and I understand the frustration. And I would say, every quarter, we go through this, we say we want to make sure that we've got everything. But we are -- we have to make sure that when we look at these remediations, they're aligned with what makes sense for the customer and that we've captured all the portfolios. And some of our -- some of these remediations required us to go back and recreate a scenario from 10, 15 years ago.\nAnd so that's part of the complication that we see. And so we're not going to say that there's no more, but they're very case specific. And at some point, they will be behind us, but we have to do what we have to do. And at least in the big scheme of things relative to the benefits that we'll see from things like NII, these aren't overwhelming.\nAnd we understand how this fits into the guidance that we've given on full year expenses.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYep. OK. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nHi. I guess just following up on the regulatory line of questions. And as usual, I got to ask some questions that are tough to answer. But you've acknowledged you're making significant progress.\nThe regulators have acknowledged you're making significant progress. The fundamentals are clearly moving in the right direction in a meaningful way. But in the prepared remarks, you still say you need to continue to close these gaps over the next several years? And I guess the question is, like is this just cautionary language? Or are there still things that you are implementing on kind of a daily and ongoing basis to address some of the legacy issues. I guess I thought you had implemented kind of the fixes and it's kind of the oversight and execution situation.\nBut maybe you could just talk to that.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I don't recall saying the words that you just used. I think we have been trying to be very clear that we have a lot of ongoing work to do that we feel very good about the frameworks that we have in place. But we are -- as you -- once you develop the framework, the implementation of the framework takes a significant amount of time.\nWe continue to do that. And as we develop stronger controls inside the company, we will potentially find things that then have to get fixed and remediated because this is many years of work that we're doing at this point. And as the regulators look at the amount of time that it takes to do it at the things that we find, as we put these controls in place and just some of these legacy things that continue to remain out there, I just think it's prudent that we expect to have things. I think we say it's possible or likely but if there was something specific, we would say.\nBut I think it is -- that's just -- that's the reality of the situation that we're in. And so it is -- where we find ourselves is -- and I'll speak for ourselves, not the regulators. We have made significant progress from where we were when we got here, but there is still a significant amount of more work to do.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. And then just a follow-up on a different topic. And I apologize if I missed it. But you did talk about slowing buybacks in the second quarter, partly raised, partly loans.\nAnd obviously, you bought back a lot this quarter. Did you give the magnitude that you expect to buy back or remind us your targeted capital at least until the next CCAR comes out? Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Matt, I'll take that. As we've said a few times in the past, we plan to run the CET1 ratio at somewhere between 100 and 150 basis points over our reg minimum, which right now is 9.1%. And I think as we look forward, given the way the framework works is we'll have plenty of flexibility to do what we think is prudent on buybacks as we go throughout the rest of the year.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. My questions have been asked and answered.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question will come from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. Your line is open.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nMost of my questions have been asked. But let me ask one question about how you manage your mortgage banking operation because you're one of the few large banks that still has a relatively balanced origination and servicing side. Historically, servicing was kind of viewed as a balance to origination. When originations didn't do well, servicing would do well.\nBut that hasn't been the case recently in your recent history. And so can you talk about how you're managing it and why there isn't a balance to those two pieces?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. I'll start. This is Charlie. Mike, and then you can pipe in.\nI think we think about our mortgage business in the context of the whole company, not as a separate, independent entity that has to stand by itself. And so when we think about the interest rate risk position of the entire company, that's where we think about what potentially happens on the production side versus what happens in the MSR. The management of the MSR is difficult. It's got some very different types of risks embedded in it.\nAnd all you did was look at those two as offsets, you could be kidding yourselves as to what the value of the servicing is. And so as I said, net-net-net, when we look at the position of the company, I would look at the reduction of mortgage banking income not being offset by the MSR, but being offset by the rest of the benefit that will get as a company NII.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nAnd just as a follow-up, when you gave guidance about a material step down in mortgage banking in the second quarter, were you talking strictly on the origination side or as a whole entity?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nAs a whole, think of the mortgage banking income line as what we're referring to.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd remember, included in there is the fact that the MSR is fairly well hedged. So it's basically -- it's the whole, but it's also -- what's really driving it is origination.\nOperator\nThank you. Our final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. You may go ahead.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning. Charlie, you both referenced in your comments about the excess capacity in mortgage banking and you're anticipating or waiting for some of that excess capacity to come out as originations of course, for the industry have come down to higher rates. What are some of the metrics you guys are monitoring and keeping an eye on to show you that, that capacity is coming out of the system?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think as you think about the industry as a whole, it's hard, try to look at any specific metrics per se. But I think where you're going to see that first is likely gain on sale margins as people start normalize as excess capacity comes out, right? So I think that's probably one of the areas I would look at.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. And listen, I mean, people just -- everyone in the industry looks around it. The amount of volume being down substantially. They look at the amount of expense that they have, people then rationalize the expense that they have and that naturally changes the competitive dynamics about where people are pricing.\nSo we're focused on making sure that we've got the right level of expense relative to the revenue and volume that we're seeing, and that's exactly what everyone else does.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. And Mike, just following up on your gain on sale and margin -- gain on the sale margins. What would you consider normal? And where are they for you guys today?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, we don't disclose the margin itself as you sort of look forward. But normal varies, right, as you sort of look through the cycle in the mortgage business. And so I think we're certainly -- if you start thinking about primary, secondary spreads, that's one indicator of sort of where gain on sale margins will go, I think. And we're now back to what is likely more historical levels right around 100 basis points or so when you look at that.\nAnd that's -- so I think you're kind of back to a more normal level there. And then I think as excess capacity goes out, like you'll start to see the gain on sale come back up. So I think it's hard to say exactly what normal will look like there as we go through the cycle.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK. And then just as a follow-up question. Mike, you alluded to the possibility that the stress capital buffer following this year CCAR could be a little higher for you folks. Is there -- can you give us some color what is making you think that way?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nIt's just the severity of the variables that went into it, Gerard. And obviously, it's a bit of a black box in terms of what -- exactly what the answer is. And so we're -- we do our best to try to look at like how that might impact us and how the Fed might look at it. But it's really based on the severity of the scenario that played through.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. I appreciate the color. Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd I think that's the last question. So we know it's a really busy day for everyone. So we thank you for spending the time, and we'll talk soon.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 67 minutes\nCall participants:\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nMore WFC analysis\nAll earnings call transcripts"}

[Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today, where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our third-quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie. \nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n\u00a0Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our third-quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third-quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some third-quarter highlights.\nWe earned $5.1 billion or $1.17 per common share in the third quarter. These results included a $1.7 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses as credit quality continued to improve. Revenue declined on lower gains from equity securities, which were elevated in the second quarter, though still strong. Expenses continue to decline, reflecting progress on our efficiency initiatives and included $250 million associated with the September OCC enforcement action.\nAnd for the first time since first-quarter 2020, we grew both period-end loans and deposits in the third quarter. We continue to see that our customers have significant liquidity and consumers are continuing to spend. While lower than the peak in March, our consumer customers' median deposit balances continued to remain above pre-pandemic levels, up 48% for customers who received federal stimulus and 40 -- I'm sorry, up 48% for customers who received federal stimulus and 40% higher for those who did not receive federal aid. Weekly debit card spend during the third quarter was up every week compared to 2019 and in the week ending October 1 was up 14% compared to 2020 and 26% compared to 2019.\nAreas hardest hit by the pandemic have recovered, including travel, up 2%; entertainment, up 39%; and restaurant spending, up 20% during the week ending October 1 compared with 2019. Consumer credit card spending activity continued to increase, up 18% in the third quarter compared to 2019 and 24% compared to 2020. During the week ended October 1, travel-related spending, which was hardest hit during the pandemic, was up significantly from 2020 but remains the only category that is not yet fully rebounded to 2019 levels, still down 8% compared to 2019. Commercial banking loans were up slightly at the end of the third quarter, while line utilization was stable at historic lows.\nSupply chain difficulties and labor shortages continue to represent significant challenges for our client base. And as I said earlier, overall credit performance continued to be strong. Now let me update you on the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. First, building an appropriate risk and control infrastructure has been and remains Wells Fargo's top priority.\nWe reached a significant milestone with the termination of the CFPB consent order issued in September 2016 regarding improper retail sales practices. Its expiration reflects years of hard work by employees across Wells Fargo, intended to ensure that the conduct at the core of the CFPB order will not recur. As a reminder, this is the second important regulatory milestone we achieved this year with the OCC terminating a consent order related to our BSA/AML compliance program in January. But the recent OCC actions are a reminder that the significant deficiencies that existed when I arrived must remain our top priority.\nI believe we're making meaningful progress, and I remain confident in our ability to close the remaining gaps over the next several years. Having said that, it continues to be the case that we are likely to have setbacks along the way. We are a different bank today than we were several years ago. We run the company with greater oversight, transparency, and operational disciplines.\nWe have a new leadership team. 15 of 18 operating committee members are now new to their roles. I've spoken of our new leaders in many of our control functions, but we also have many new business leaders. This includes new leaders in consumer banking, small business banking, auto lending, home lending, credit card, merchant services, retail services, and personal lending, digital, strategy, wealth and investment management, and commercial banking.\nOur control infrastructure is different, and we continue to invest in it. We take a different approach to the consumer today. We created a sales practice oversight and management function and an Office of Consumer Practices. Our approach to consumer remediation is dramatically different as we have meaningfully increased the amount paid to consumers and have accelerated payments to customers.\nWhile we are committed to devoting the resources necessary to our risk and regulatory work, we are also focused on improving the products and services we offer. We're making investments in digital capabilities and making it easier for customers to do business with us. In the third quarter, we announced our new long-term digital infrastructure strategy that will move us to a multi-cloud environment. This is a critical step in our multiyear journey to be digital-first and offer easier-to-use products and services.\nWe also joined AutoFi's North American network to provide car buyers and dealers with fast and easy online sales and financing. And as I've spoken about previously, we're on track to roll out a new consumer mobile app at the beginning of next year. We've also been making significant enhancements to our payments capabilities and are seeing that momentum pull through on our customers' Zelle usage, with Zelle users increasing 24%, transactions up 50%, and volumes are up 56% from a year ago. We're executing on our work to simplify our products and build compelling offerings tailored to different customer segments.\nClear Access, our no-fee overdraft checking product now has over 1 million outstanding customer accounts. As a reminder, this launched in September 2020. And all of our retail accounts, which receive ACH direct deposit have our Overdraft Rewind feature, which automatically reevaluates transactions from the prior business day that have incurred an overdraft. This feature has helped over 1.3 million customers avoid overdraft-related fees on 2.5 million transactions in the third quarter.\nFor the emerging affluent and affluent segments, we're making substantial changes to more consistently and intentionally serve these customers, including products, service, marketing, and management routines. You'll hear us talk more about how we're executing on this in the coming quarters. After successfully launching Active Cash, our new cash-back credit card in July earlier this month, we launched the Reflect Card that rewards customers for making on-time payments. Our new Head of Small Business, Derek Ellington, will start in just a couple of days, and we believe this is another attractive growth segment for us.\nNext month, Paul Camp will be joining Wells Fargo as the Head of our Global Treasury Management businesses. This new role brings together our treasury management and global payment solutions teams into one organization, which will enable us to be more efficient and leverage our capabilities more effectively to help clients manage their funds and process payments worldwide. While we've been focused on improving the products and services we offer to our customers, we've continued to support our communities. We voluntarily committed to donate all gross processing fees from PPP loans funded in 2020 and created the Open for Business Fund to support small businesses impacted by the pandemic.\nWe've now donated $305 million in support of small business recovery, including 215 CDFIs, which, in turn, is expected to help nearly 150,000 small business owners maintain more than 250,000 jobs. Additionally, in the third quarter, we launched Connect to More, a resource hub for women-owned businesses and a mentoring program partnering with Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center to empower 500 women-owned businesses. We committed to invest $5 million through the NeighborhoodLIFT program to help more than 300 low- and moderate-income residents in Philadelphia with home down payment assistance. And we published our updated ESG report and goals and performance data, which includes new disclosures on our workforce by race, gender, and job category.\nAs we look forward, while there certainly are risks that remain, including the latest wave of COVID infections, the recent U.S. fiscal policy stalemate, and inflation concerns, the outlook for the economy is promising. Consumers' financial condition remains strong with leverage at its lowest level in 45 years and the debt burden below its long-term average. Companies are also strong as well.\nWe remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past on a run-rate basis at some point next year, and we'll then discuss our plan to continue to increase returns. I want to thank our employees for continuing to work hard to make Wells Fargo better for our customers, shareholders, and communities. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\u00a0\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Charlie summarized how we're helping our customers and communities on Slide 2, so I'm going to start with our third-quarter financial results on Slide 3. Net income for the quarter was $5.1 billion or $1.17 per common share. Our results included a $1.7 billion decrease in the allowance for credit losses.\nThis is reflective of the continuing improvement in credit performance and the economic recovery. Pretax pre-provision profit grew from a year ago as lower revenue, driven by a decline in net interest income, was more than offset by lower expenses. We continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives, which has helped improve the expense run rate. And as Charlie highlighted, the third quarter included $250 million in operating losses associated with the September OCC enforcement action.\nNoninterest income was relatively stable from a year ago. Within that, equity gains declined from the second quarter but increased $220 million from a year ago, predominantly due to our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. We also had an increase in investment advisory and other asset-based fees from a year ago, as well as in card, deposit related and investment banking fees. These increases were more than offset by declines in other areas, including lower mortgage banking revenue and lower markets revenue in corporate and investment banking.\nOur effective income tax rate in the third quarter was 22.9%. Our CET1 ratio declined to 11.6% in the third quarter as we repurchased $5.3 billion of common stock. As a reminder, our regulatory minimum will be 9.1% in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a lower GSIB capital surcharge. Additionally, under the stress capital buffer framework, we have flexibility to increase capital distributions and if possible, we will be able to repurchase more than the $18 billion included in our capital plan over the four-quarter period, depending on market conditions and other risk factors, including COVID-related risks.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our net loan charge-off ratio was 12 basis points in the quarter. Commercial credit performance continued to improve, and net loan charge-offs declined $42 million from the second quarter to 3 basis points. The improvement was broad-based and included modest net recoveries in our energy portfolio and in commercial real estate.\nThe commercial real estate portfolio has continued to perform well. The recovery in retail and hotel properties reflected increased liquidity and improved valuations. While we have not seen any widespread stress in office, we continue to watch this sector closely and believe that any impact as a result of return to office or hybrid working plans will take time to play out. Consumer credit performance also continued to improve with strong collateral values for homes and autos and consumer cash reserves remaining above pre-pandemic levels.\nNet loan charge-offs declined $80 million from the second quarter to 23 basis points. We continue to have net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios, and losses in both credit card and auto declined. Nonperforming assets declined $321 million or 4% from the second quarter, driven by lower commercial nonaccruals, with declines across all asset types. Energy was the largest driver, given significant improvement in fundamentals on the back of higher commodity prices.\nOur allowance level at the end of the third quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, the continuing economic recovery, and the uncertainties that still remain. If economic -- current economic trends continue, we would expect to have additional reserve releases. On Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were relatively stable from the second quarter with a decline in residential mortgage loans, largely offset by modest growth in our -- in most of our consumer and commercial portfolios.\nTotal period end of loans grew for the first time since the first quarter of 2020 and were up $10.5 billion from the second quarter with growth in commercial and industrial loans, auto, other consumer, credit card, and commercial real estate. Average deposits increased $51.9 billion or 4% from a year ago with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking, partially offset by continued declines in corporate and investment banking and corporate treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Turning to net interest income on Slide 7. Net interest income grew $109 million or 1% from the second quarter and was down $470 million or 5% from a year ago.\nThe decrease from a year ago was driven by lower loan balances and the impact of lower yields on earning assets, partially offset by a decline in long-term debt and lower premium amortization on our mortgage-backed securities. We had $20 billion of loans we purchased out of mortgage-backed securities or EPBOs at the end of the third quarter, down $4 billion from the second quarter. These loans do contribute to net interest income, and we expect these EPBO loan balances to decline substantially by the end of 2022. At the end of the third quarter, we also had $4.7 billion of PPP loans outstanding, and we expect the balances to steadily decline over the next several quarters and to be under $1 billion by the end of next year.\nWe continue to expect net interest income to be near the bottom of our initial guidance range of flat to down 4% from the annualized fourth-quarter 2020 level of $36.8 billion for the full year. Turning to expenses on Slide 8. Noninterest expense declined 13% from a year ago. The decrease was driven by lower restructuring charges and operating losses and the progress we've made on our efficiency initiatives.\nDuring the first nine months of this year, these initiatives have helped to drive a 16% decline in professional and outside services expense by reducing our spend on consultants and contractors, an 8% reduction in occupancy costs by reducing the number of locations, including branches and offices. Occupancy costs have also declined from lower COVID-19 related costs and a 5% decline in salaries expense by eliminating management layers and increasing expansion controls across the organization and optimizing branch staffing. Now let me provide some specific examples of progress we're making on some of the initiatives. We are continuing to work on reducing the underlying costs to run our Consumer Banking business.\nThe pandemic accelerated customer migration to digital, which continue with mobile log-ons up 14% in the third quarter from a year ago. While teller transactions were flat from a year ago, they were over 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels as transactions have migrated ATMs and mobile. Over the past year, we've reduced our number of branches by 433 or 8% and lowered headcount and branch banking by 23%. We continue to focus on generating efficiencies in our branches and have a number of initiatives designed to further reduce expenses, including reducing cash handling time and simplifying certain branch processes.\nWealth and investment management has had strong increases in revenue-related compensation. However, by executing on efficiency initiatives, nonrevenue-related expenses in the third quarter declined 6% from a year ago, and non-advisor headcount was down 10% from a year ago. We have aligned our wealth management business under eight divisional leaders, creating better coordination and efficiency. We have also implemented a more efficient client service model across all distribution channels and have reduced total square footage by rationalizing our real estate footprint.\nCorporate and investment banking has continued to make progress on various efficiency initiatives. These efforts include reducing headcount supporting products, regions, or sectors with low levels of market activity and opportunity, optimizing operations and support teams, vendor optimization and insourcing, and reducing spend on contractors and consultants. We're also working on initiatives in centralized functions, including operations, where we have realized savings from location optimization, lower third-party spending by eliminating consulting arrangements, and consolidating vendors. The operations group has also reduced spend and layers with savings coming from eliminating manager roles.\nAutomation efforts and strategy enhancements have driven process improvements while reducing costs in many areas, including fraud management and card collections. We've also been working on additional opportunities through technology enablement that have longer lead times, but should result in benefits that we expect will reduce operations-related expenses over time. With three quarters of actual results already, our current outlook for 2021 expenses, excluding restructuring charges and the cost of business exits, is approximately $53.5 billion. Note that we had $193 million of restructuring charges and cost of business exits during the first nine months of the year.\nThis outlook includes an expectation of higher operating losses and higher revenue-related expenses than we assumed earlier in the year. Our expense outlook also assumes a full year of expenses related to Wells Fargo Asset Management and our Corporate Trust Services business, and we expect these sales to close during the fourth quarter. We will update you on the expense impact of these initiatives after they close. As mentioned, the outlook accounts for the fact that we expect full-year operating losses to be approximately $250 million higher than our assumptions at the beginning of the year.\nThis includes approximately $1 billion of operating losses incurred during the first nine months of the year, and our outlook assumes $250 million of operating losses in the fourth quarter. Just a reminder that operating losses can be lumpy and unpredictable, especially as we continue to address the significant work needed to satisfy our regulatory requirements. Our current outlook also assumes revenue-related compensation will be approximately $1 billion this year, which is higher than the $500 million we assumed at the beginning of the year. Strong equity markets have driven revenue-related expenses, which is a good thing as the associated revenue more than offsets any increase in expenses.\nNow turning to our business segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 9. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 2% from a year ago, primarily due to an increase in consumer activity, including higher debit card transactions and lower COVID-related fee waivers. Home Lending revenue declined 20% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in mortgage banking income, driven by lower gain-on-sale margins, origination volumes, and servicing fees. Net interest income also declined, driven by lower loan balances.\nThese declines were partially offset by higher gains from the resecuritization of loans we purchased from mortgage-backed securities last year. Credit card revenue was up 4% from a year ago, driven by increased spending and lower customer accommodations and fee waivers in response to the pandemic. Auto revenue increased 10% from a year ago on higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 10.\nOur mortgage originations declined 2% from the second quarter with correspondent originations growing 2%, which was more than offset by a 5% decline in retail. We currently expect our fourth-quarter originations to decline modestly, given the recent increase in mortgage rates and the typical seasonal trends in the purchase market. Despite strong consumer demand for autos, inventory shortages are putting downward pressure on industry sales and driving higher prices. The competitive environment has remained relatively stable, and we've had our second consecutive quarter of record originations with volume up 70% from a year ago.\nTurning to debit card. Transactions were relatively stable from the second quarter and up 11% from a year ago, with increases across nearly all categories. We had strong growth in new credit card accounts up 63% from the second quarter, driven by the launch of our new Active Cash Card. Credit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 24% from a year ago and 4% from the second quarter.\nWhile payment rates remain high, average balances grew 3% from the second quarter, the first-time balances have grown since the fourth quarter of 2020. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 11. Middle-market banking revenue declined 3% from a year ago, primarily due to lower loan balances and lower interest rates, which were partially offset by higher deposit balances and deposit-related fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 12% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and lower lease income.\nNoninterest expense declined 14% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower salaries and consulting expense due to efficiency initiatives, as well as lower lease expense. After declining for four consecutive quarters, average loans stabilized in the third quarter, line utilizations remained low and loan demand continued to be impacted by low client inventory levels and strong client cash positions. However, there was some increase in demand late in the quarter and period-end balances increased $1.6 billion or 1% from the second quarter. Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 12.\nIn banking, total revenue increased 12% from a year ago. This growth was driven by higher advisory and equity origination fees and an increase in loan balances, partially offset by lower deposit balances predominantly due to actions taken to manage under the asset cap. Commercial real estate revenue grew 10% from a year ago, driven by higher commercial servicing income, loan balances and capital markets results in stronger commercial gain-on-sale volumes and margins and higher underwriting fees. Markets revenue declined 15% from a year ago, driven by lower trading activity across most asset classes, primarily due to market conditions.\nNoninterest expense declined 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by reduced operations expense due to efficiency initiatives. Wealth and investment management revenue on Slide 13 grew 10% from a year ago. A decline in net interest income due to lower interest rates was more than offset by higher asset-based fees primarily due to higher market valuations. Revenue-related compensation drove the increase in noninterest expense from a year ago.\nI highlighted earlier the progress we've made on efficiency initiatives to reduce nonrevenue-related expenses, including salaries and occupancy expense. Client assets increased 13% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher market valuations. Average deposits were up 4% from a year ago, and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. And Slide 14 highlights our corporate results.\nRevenue declined from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income, primarily due to the sale of our student loan portfolio and lower noninterest income due to lower gains on the sale of securities in our investment portfolio. The decline in revenue from the second quarter was primarily driven by lower equity gains from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, and expenses included the $250 million operating loss associated with the OCC enforcement action in September. With that, we will now take your questions.\u00a0\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers -- PIper Sandler -- Analyst\nGood morning. Thanks for taking my question. I just was hoping you could sort of address the cost outlook. I certainly appreciate the commentary regarding the fourth quarter in particular.\nI think as we look forward, you guys have had the expectation that costs could come down year over year for the next couple of years. I mean that, of course, puts you guys in a very unique position vis-a-vis many of your peers. But so many people are talking about things like wage inflation right now. Just curious to what degree are you seeing that and more importantly, is there enough flexibility in your existing outlook such that even despite higher wage pressures, you could still see costs down year over year for the next couple of years.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. This is Charlie. Thanks for the question. I guess let me start with the wage inflation.\nI think we certainly are seeing wage inflation. I would say it's very different across different parts of the company and very different across different job categories that we have. And so as we approach it, we're trying to be very thoughtful about ensuring that we're continuing to be as fair with people as we can be, as well as paying competitively. We actually are making awards to people in our branches, which equate to roughly $2.50 an hour from the beginning of October through the end of the year, to thank them from what they're doing, but also address the competitiveness that exists out there, and we're evaluating what makes sense for the longer term.\nAnd in places of the company where we do see wage pressure, we're acting accordingly. But I would not say that it's something that we see everywhere across the entire company in every single job. But we're certainly prepared for it and look at it very, very regularly as we look at things like attrition and whatnot. To the broader question, I think, first of all, we're in the middle of doing our budgets now, as I'm sure you hear from everyone when they do these calls at this time of year.\nOur goal is still the same that we've said in the past, which is we still would like to see net reductions in the overall expense base. We are in a unique position in that, I would say, in two ways. First of all, we do have the significant amount that we're spending on regulatory orders, and we're not assuming that we get efficiencies out of that in the near future. But one day when we're -- when we have built all that's required, that will be an opportunity for us, but that's not even on the radar screen for us right now.\nBut we still have just tremendous excess expenses across the company. You can see it in headcount. You can see it in efficiency ratios across the businesses. And what I found here is the same thing, I think, that Mike and I've seen in a lot of other places, which is it's like peeling an onion back.\nYou think you see what's incredibly clear. Once you actually get rid of those inefficiencies, you then start to see the next level and it becomes part of the culture, and we engaged the entire company in moving that way. So we still think that they're extremely meaningful efficiencies that we can pursue for quite some time here, which hopefully will both allow us to have net reductions, but also invest appropriately, whether it's in technology or products, which as we've said, we're extremely focused on as well.\nScott Siefers -- PIper Sandler -- Analyst\nPerfect. Thank you very much. And then I was hoping, Mike, you might be able to expand on a comment you made about loan growth -- or excuse me, loan demand improving later in the quarter. There seems to be a little bit of a divergence emerging between the kind of demand we're seeing it, say, smaller and middle-market companies, for instance, versus what we're seeing with larger corporates that might have better access to the capital markets.\nCurious if you could just provide a little more color on where you're seeing that improved demand, please?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\n\u00a0Yeah. And I assume we will see some divergence across different -- some of the peers as you sort of look at this. But if you look at the commercial bank, as an example, we're actually seeing the demand and the pipeline build in kind of the middle and upper end of the client base with a little bit less of demand emerging so far on the lower end, which I know is counter to what you -- the way you asked the question, but I think that's what we're seeing right now. And I think in part, that's because the clients in the lower end of our client base still have a lot of excess liquidity and they're still dealing with supply chain crunches and other issues that are sort of impacting their need for liquidity and their need for credit.\nAnd so I think -- and I think that will -- we'll start to see more demand, I think, more consistently across the client base over time as things play out, but that's what we're seeing in the commercial bank. I think when you look more broadly and you look at the consumer side, we have seen balances grow in auto. We've seen them in card. When you look through the home lending data that we give you, we are seeing growth on our kind of core nonconforming mortgage book as well.\nThat's offset by the declines in the loans that we bought out from securities last year, but we are seeing some growth there, too. And then you see some growth in the corporate investment bank. And that's really a little bit of a lot of things happening across the corporate investment bank, whether it's real estate, subscription finance, and other sectors that are really driving some of that growth. And so again, it's still relatively modest so far in terms of what we've seen.\nAnd I think it will take some more time for it to really play out in a more meaningful way. But it's encouraging to start to see at least a little bit manifest so far.\u00a0\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I would just encourage you to make sure that you look at the period-end balances, as well as the averages because it certainly gets to the heart of the question. And then just one final thing I'll say on this, which is we're not stretching in any way in terms of credit or pricing or things like that to try and get to a result. We're continuing to have the same disciplines that we've always had, and it's going to be a question of our balances are rising because of greater customer activity.\nScott Siefers -- PIper Sandler -- Analyst\nThat's terrific. Thank you, guys, very much.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHey, guys. Thanks. Good morning. Just wondering, Mike, if you could just talk a little bit about just some of the ins and outs underneath NII outside from balance sheet movements, meaning you saw a little bit of increase in premium am.\nCan you just remind us like how that mechanism works in terms of what rates need to do to have an ongoing improvement there? And are you at the point -- how close are you to the point where your incremental purchases or replacements on the securities book are getting closer to what's going off? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Thanks, Ken. I think when you think about premium amortization, I think you said it backwards, but like we're getting a benefit from premium amortization coming down in the quarter. And you saw that in our results is roughly $90 million, a little bit, maybe a couple of bucks less, but -- and so we expect -- as we've been saying, we expect that to continue to come down.\nI think it will be somewhat gradual as we look out the next couple of quarters. You're not going to see big step-downs. I think it will come down again in the fourth quarter, maybe a little less than we saw from the second to the third quarter. And as rates -- as you've seen over the last three months, rates have been a little all over the place.\nAnd so it's a bit of a function of where mortgage rates are, and there's a little bit of a lag to it as it comes through the data. So -- but we still expect the general trajectory to be coming down on premium amortization. It's just a matter of exactly how fast and over what time period that will happen. I think on the second part of the question, what was the second part again, Ken, the --\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nJust about reinvestment rates versus the underlying portfolio on the securities book?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No. And again, even on that, I keep reminding people, as you sort of look at the third quarter and rates were much, much lower than they are today for most of the second quarter. And so really, we've seen them rally at the tail end of the quarter and kind of stabilize to come down slightly since then over the last week or so.\nAnd so that gap is closing, obviously, in terms of what's rolling off and getting closer to kind of the overall average in the portfolio. But we still have a little ways to go to -- for rates to -- for reinvestment rates to match sort of what's rolling out of the portfolio.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. And just last quick one. Just long-term debt, you've been meaningfully reducing the footprint and helped by the mix improving on the balance sheet.\nJust how much more of an opportunity is that to continue to lower the long-term debt footprint and reduce the cost of it? Thanks, Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, yes. No. It's a good question. And I think our constraint is going to be TLAC, how much TLAC we have to hold.\nAnd I think you can probably model that out a little bit. So we have a little bit more room to go to continue to optimize the mix here and bring the long-term debt down. But it's likely at some point -- it's likely at some point next year, that will start to change.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good afternoon. So I wanted to ask a follow-up on Ken's last line of questioning around the NII outlook. And if I take all the different component pieces that you mentioned and just throw it in the blender, so more constructive loan growth commentary, some modest but steady premium, and benefit, but still some reinvestment headwinds.\nIs it reasonable to expect that you can grow NII versus the lower end of the guidance range for '21? And separately, what's your appetite to deploy excess liquidity just given your excess reserves parked at the Fed at least as a percentage of the overall balance sheet is still quite elevated relative to many of your peers?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Maybe I'll start with the second one, and I'll come back to the first part, Steven. As we think about redeployment, we're still being pretty patient. And as I just mentioned to Ken's question, you look at what's been happening over the last few months, rates were much lower.\nThey rallied recently. At the same time, the basis between treasuries and mortgages is actually compressed a bit, so made them a little bit relatively more expensive. And so I think -- so we're -- and if you look at what's happening in inflation and with tapering coming and we still think that there's more risk to upside on rates than there is downside at this point. And so we're still being patient as we sort of look at our redeployment there.\nAnd when opportunities present themselves, we'll take advantage of them. And we did that a little bit at -- right at the end of the third quarter where we accelerated some purchases that we were making given the spike in the rally that we saw there. And so we'll continue to do that, but we're going to be patient as we see how things develop over the coming months. As you sort of think about the range for the full year, we've been giving a range for a reason, right, because there's a lot of moving pieces, right? And there's still a few months to play out.\nAnd I think if we obviously, see faster loan growth than we expect that will be a positive. If we see rates move a little bit higher than what the forward curve has, that will be positive. We have -- we still have to -- just to keep up with where the securities portfolio, we have a lot of purchases to make in the fourth quarter. And so where rates end up throughout will be important.\nAnd then on the margin, there's things like PPP and other factors that sort of drive that, and that will be determined based on the client forgiveness trends that we see in our client base. So I think there are scenarios where we could be a little bit better than what we projected there. And there are some scenarios where we could be a little bit worse, depending on how all those factors play out.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nAnd that's great color. Thanks for taking my question.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHi. I wanted to follow up on the expenses. When we think about the aspiration for expenses to be down next year and understanding that you're going through budgeting and that's a goal right now, Mike, is that -- can we think of it as that your goal kind of relative to the 53.5 and wouldn't include help from the business exits?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, John. No, I think we think about the business exits just separate from the core efficiency we're driving. And for lack of a better way to describe it, if you -- if we think that there's going to be a savings of X dollars as these businesses roll off, take the 53.5 and subtract the X, and that will be the new -- our new goal, our starting place, yes. And so -- and when we gave you at a high level some detail about that in April and when these close and we've got good clarity on it, we'll be very transparent about how to reset the baseline and the starting point.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nSure. And in terms of you expect some gains on sales, I assume those are your thinking in the same lines, and those should probably come in the fourth quarter is what you're currently thinking?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. They may not all be in the fourth quarter given how the deals were structured, like not 100% of the gains will be in the fourth quarter, but a good chunk of it will be in the fourth quarter. And obviously, we'll be clear on what that was when it happens.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And the last thing for me is if we want to dream about loan growth coming back for the industry, how do we think about how much capacity you have to grow loans while staying under the asset cap? And where does that come from? It comes from cash, liquidity, mix, and moving other stuff around the balance sheet? Can you just give us some thoughts on that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. We all dream of faster loan growth. So I think we're aligned there. But look, I think we've got plenty of room to grow on the loan side.\nAnd whether it comes from initially from cash that's sitting at the Fed or that would be the kind of the first place. But if we needed to, we could reduce the securities portfolio as well. If it grew much faster than what we expected, that would be a nice problem to have. But at this point, we have plenty of capacity to grow.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. I guess just one big-picture question, Charlie. I appreciate you mentioning the risk of setbacks as you go through the whole regulatory process. At the same time, when we talk to investors, I think there's a franchise the longer you stay within that asset cap.\nI was wondering if you could address just in terms of when we think about the franchise, both from a talent and client standpoint, how -- what should your shareholders be about that? Or do you think that's well taken care of?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think it's -- well, I would say I do think it's well taken care of, I'll start there, but I think we think about it every day that we take actions to stay below the cap. I think, as Mike talked -- just spoke about, we have significant room on the asset side of the balance sheet, which is where you really want to be there for clients where they need you. And so when you're out hustling for business, we're certainly able to fulfill their needs on -- it doesn't matter whether it's a consumer or whether it's a corporate. Our experience has been that we continue to find ways to optimize the balance sheet in a way that has very little client impact and where we have to move deposits off the balance sheet.\nWe work with customers to come up with other off-balance sheet solutions for them. And I think our experience has been that customers are very, very understanding of what that is. So again, I think, as we think about -- and by the way, we have not limited the growth of deposits on the consumer side at all. So when we think about the more long-term impacts, I think we certainly would have liked to have been in a different position if we had a choice, but we're trying to be very smart about having as little franchise impact as possible when we make these decisions and make sure we're communicating with customers.\nAnd I think the people here at Wells have done an amazing job of striking that right balance. And as I said, I think we're as open for business as anyone on the asset side. And I think customers appreciate that as well.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks for shedding that perspective. Just one quick one, Mike, on the NII. When we look at the fourth-quarter, year-on-year, full-year guidance, should -- does the net-net of all of that imply that fourth-quarter NII should at least grow from third-quarter levels? And can you disclose what the PPP impact was for the third-quarter NII number?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I think on the fourth quarter, you can model like based on what your assumptions are, right? And as I said, we'll be sort of near the bottom of the range, and you can sort of pick where you think we'll be based on how you feel about it. I think for the third quarter, the PPP impact was about $115 million. And just to give you a little context, that was a little bit lower than what we saw in the second quarter, and we would expect the fourth quarter to be a little bit lower than that potentially, but that will all be based on how clients the pace of forgiveness request that we get from clients.\nBut overall, a pretty small sequential impact. That's all baked in our forecast.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. How -- on the expense side, how should we think about the timing and the magnitude of the remaining $4.3 billion in cost saves? And would you say that any of the latest regulatory developments impacted how you're thinking about the magnitude or the timing of the realization of those saves? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, John, it's Mike. As we said at the beginning of the year, we were going to get about $3.7 billion of the $8 billion this year, and the annualized impact starts to build as you go through the year. So some of that you get in the run rate coming out of 2021. And some of that will take more time to get at.\nAnd as I mentioned, where we have to introduce new technology or other new capabilities, it just takes longer to get at some of it. And as we sort of said in the beginning of the year, this is a multiyear plan. So we're not going to get all of that in the first 12 months by any stretch. And as we get to January, we'll give you a better view of what to expect on 2022.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. And then separately, on the loan front, can you just maybe give us a little more detail on the trends you're seeing in the card business, including spending volume, as well as payment rates? And then separately, any thoughts on the impact of the \"buy now, pay later\" product on how you're thinking about your product set? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I think when you look at payment rates, they're still really high, like they bounce around a little bit month-to-month in the last quarter or so, but they're still really high. And so what you're getting -- when you look at the balance growth you're seeing, you're really getting that through an increase in the point-of-sale purchase volumes that are coming through. Charlie highlighted a bunch of stats based on what we're seeing in the book.\nBut I'd say overall, spend patterns, spend is pretty -- still pretty strong, pretty stable from what we saw in the second quarter, up versus the comparable periods last year or in 2019. And as you'd expect in any given week or month or quarter, the different categories move around quite a bit depending on what's happening for what's happening based on that time period. And then I think when you look at -- so you can see that point-of-sale volumes are up 24% from the quarter a year ago, 4% sequentially. And you can see the new account growth, which is up quite a bit under 50% from a year ago and 63% from the second quarter based on the new products we've launched.\nSo we're still -- I'd characterize it as still really strong activity levels despite the noise you see out there related to the Delta variant and other things.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd on the -- this is Charlie, on buy now, pay later, I would say I would describe buy now, pay later as another option of providing credit and serving the merchant. I think it's -- I think as others have said, it's still overall a relatively small portion of the market. But I think there'll be a place for it, but it's not going to supplant all the other types of credit that exist out there. We have our own retail services business.\nWe have our own personal lending business. So -- and we've got a significant number of merchant relationships ourselves. So it's a place that we will be in addition to the products that we have. And over time, my guess is it will continue -- it will -- you're seeing a proliferation of people involved now.\nAt some time, at some point, it will become far more consolidated for all the reasons that these other industries have been consolidated, including those that can really provide a differentiated experience for the merchant. So hopefully, that helps.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nThanks, Charlie. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nHey, guys. Charlie, I wanted to follow up again on the comment about likely to have additional setbacks on the regulatory stuff, and just to push here for a little bit, if you don't mind. Is this kind of like a broad risk statement just in case like you never know? Or should we just be prepared for something more meaningful, whether it's a speed bump or potential land mine between here and specifically the end of the asset cap, which I think everyone views as a key turning point?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI guess I would describe it this way. I mean everyone focuses on the asset cap, and I understand all the reasons for that, for sure. And I think just what's important to us is that we want to make sure that there's complete transparency, which we believe we have, if you read our 10-Q. But also, we want to make sure that you're just thinking about the broad set of things that we're dealing with.\nAnd the reality is the asset cap embedded in the Fed consent order is one very important order, but we still have other consent orders with other agencies, which are still extraordinarily important. We have other inquiries that are in progress that are described in there. And so I just think it's important that we're completely transparent. It's nothing different than what we've been saying.\nAnd when you talk about speed bump versus land mines, hopefully, we all work to make sure that we minimize the likelihood of a land mine. But as I said before, there's the interconnectedness, just the pure amount of things that we have to do are complex. We're judged on practices that were in place years ago, as well as practices that are in place today. And we're judged based upon the overall progress, based upon the initial due dates of some of these things.\nAnd so nothing changes my perspective about -- net-net, are we moving forward? I absolutely believe we are. Again, we have -- we're able to see all the internal metrics, every interim date, and things like that, which the outsiders can't see. But we choose our words very careful on things like that. And so I just want to make sure that people understand that we have these things that are out there and don't want you to be surprised if something happens, but it doesn't change our point of view of what the opportunity is and how confident we are about being able to close these things.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nAnd as a follow-up, I know you can't tell us what the conversation kind of content is with the regulators, but can you at least tell us like do you have like the point of conversation like on the asset cap, you submitted a plan, you accepted it, like how long is this going to take. Like is there -- we are just on the outside trying to understand like what the level of communication is because I think on some front, there's a lot of communication, like the OCC, I think sits in all the banks offices. So there's a lot of regular communication there. But with the Fed and the asset cap, it's kind of like -- is there any conversation about it, even if you can't tell us --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSo a couple of things. First of all, we have -- and I think this is not just us, I think this is true of all banks. We have regular conversations with all of our regulators. Absolutely with the OCC, as you say, there are many examiners in our offices on a regular basis.\nBut we have an extremely open and interactive relationship with the CFPB, with the Fed, with the FDIC, and all other appropriate regulators, including the SEC, FINRA overseas regulators, and that is the way we treat the relationships. I have found the Fed to be clear, consistent in their approach to issues that relate to supervision. I think that's just a general comment that I would say. I haven't seen things deviate from that.\nAnd as I've said, when you look at the consent order, it doesn't say submit a plan, and then we'll talk about lifting the asset cap. It describes them there what we have to do. And so you should just assume that there's -- there is -- we have a constant level of engagement that we're really clear on what we have to do, and we're doing the work to get there.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. That's helpful color. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Mike, can you share with us -- your credit quality is very strong, similar to many in the industry. Your net charge-off ratio, of course, was an incredibly low 12 basis points. Do you have an idea how long you could kind of sustain such a strong level of net charge-offs? And when you -- when it may reach a more normalized level sometime looking out? And then second, your reserves relative to loans, I think, were about 170 basis points.\nAnd when we go back to that day one CECL number that you guys put out in January of 2020, it was about 93 basis points. And that difference, you're about the widest of all your peers. So any thoughts on just where the reserve could go as well? Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Thanks, Gerard. A couple of things. I think so far, we've all, I think, in the industry have been wrong about when credit or how credit will normalize.\nAnd at some point, I think we all expect that we're going to get back to more normal charge-off rates. Now having said that, the new normal might be different if people keep higher -- sustained higher liquidity balances throughout time. So I think that's something that still play out. I think at this point, as Charlie highlighted in his script, we still -- people still have high liquidity balances.\nWe're seeing high payoff rates and credit cards and other loans. And so there's no reason to think that we shouldn't continue to have strong credit performance in the near term. It may not be 12 basis points, but it should still be historically quite strong, at least in the near term, and we'll see how it starts to normalize. I think as it --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nLet me add one thing on that. I just think when we think about long-term earnings power of the company, and we talk about our ability to get to sustainable return numbers, we assume that the charge-off number will go up from there. So we agree it's extremely low, that it won't stay here. And just as you think about when we think about our returns, we make adjustments for that.\nAnd so if they do start to rise next year, then it's -- it will be hopefully in our assumptions. And if not, then we'll get there sooner maybe, but we'll explain why.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And as it relates to the coverage ratio today, as we've said for the last couple of quarters, we continue to be reserved for a whole different -- a whole number of different scenarios. And it hopefully will prove out to be very conservative relative to what plays out over the coming quarters. And if we continue to see trends continue, we'll have more releases as we go.\nI think whether you get back to day one CECL levels or not, I think it's a really almost impossible question to answer, given it's going to be a function of all the variables you now have to consider and what your outlook is, what the different risks are at that time. And if you go back to first quarter of 2020, I think we had, what, 3.5% unemployment at that point. And it was a very -- I think pre-COVID, it was a very kind of utopian environment, I think, from an economic perspective. And so will we be getting back to exactly that outlook? Hard to say.\nBut I think we continue to think if things play out, we'll have more releases, and that number will go down.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. And then as a follow-up, can you give us an update in middle-market investment banking initiatives? How successful have you guys been in penetrating your existing customer base?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look, as we've highlighted, Gerard, we think that's a really big opportunity over a long period of time, but it doesn't happen in a quarter or two. It takes some time to really make sure that we've got those relationships built out in the way we want. We really started to put some extra focus on it in a very disciplined way late last year.\nSo I'd say we're still early. I think we're seeing some encouraging green shoots where we've had some opportunities that we've won over the last few months or a couple of quarters that we might not have been in a position to have before that. But this -- it will take some time to play out, but we do think the opportunity is pretty big.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi. How are you doing?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nTwo questions. One on the branch network, just wanted to get your updated thoughts on how you see your footprint today. And is there more of an opportunity to expand or to optimize?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThat's a good question, Betsy. I think we're actually doing a bunch of work on exactly what that looks like because we have been very, very focused on net reductions given the fact that we were behind some others. And so the team has done a great work and just in terms of identifying -- we'll describe them as just we had a significant number of very obvious consolidation opportunities. They're really not closures.\nThey're really consolidation where we have the appropriate local coverage. I think the work that we're doing is to really think through at this point where we have significant share, where we have less share, but we have enough concentration, what our footprint looks like in some of those places to figure out how we can actually reorient the existing number of branches that we have over a period of time. So I think the reality is we will continue to optimize because as time goes on, we will continue to need less. We're focused on not leaving communities that need our help with our solutions.\nWe're going to certainly wind up with smaller footprints in a lot of the places because branch usage is changing, but we will use that as an opportunity to figure out how to redeploy some of those resources as well.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. And then I have the same question on your wealth platform. I know you recently brought in Barry to run that. And just want to understand the strategy there, if you don't mind.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. I think we've got the strategy, it falls into kind of four distinct buckets. Number one is we have our -- think of it as our independent broker channel, where it's the old A.G. Edwards and businesses like that, we first -- that came together to form that network.\nWe have then financial advisors that work extremely closely with our bank branches and believe that's still a relatively untapped opportunity for us. We also have a platform where brokers can actually go in -- when I say independent, that was a wrong phrase in the beginning. That's -- those are people who are employees, but we have a platform where people can actually go independent and continue to do the business through us. And then we have our online business, WellsTrade.\nAnd so we've got those distinct different points of distribution, and we're focused equally on maximizing the value that existed in all of those. Historically, I think we ran it much more as just one big opportunity. And I think we feel like we have underinvested in the online piece and the independent piece for sure. And the bank branch piece is something which we think is just, as I said, just a very meaningful opportunity given the amount of affluent customers that we have in our branch footprint.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThanks.\u00a0\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Betsy.\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nHi, Charlie. Can I go back to the regulatory consent orders? I just want to get a sense from you. Given the setback we had this quarter with the additional consent order, you've obviously spent a lot on these. You've hired -- you brought in a lot of folks already since you've been there over the last two years and a lot of consultants, a lot of in-house people.\nSo what do you need to do differently, especially as a management team to not have more of those setbacks and to have it go in the direction you were hoping it would go, which is --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I would say, Vivek, there's nothing new that we have to do as far as reaching an end point. So if you said pre-consent order or post-consent order, does it change what we have to do to build out the right capabilities with the right controls, in this case, in mortgage? The answer is absolutely not. And so again, whether or not it's being done fast enough in the regulators' minds relative to how long some of these things have been going on, which predate many of us, that's the context which they need to look at this in because that's who they regulate and how they have regulated. So again, I think for us, and I'm not minimizing a consent order.\nConsent order is a very big deal. But the work that's embedded in there, the end state is the same end state that we would have contemplated building ourselves. And so there's some more -- a lot more formality that's part of the process now. And the OCC will be more deeply involved in a series of the checkpoints and things like that.\nAnd there certainly is some more work that comes out of an exercise like that, but the end state is the same.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nAnd so when you said several years, Charlie, should we be thinking of that in terms of is it a three-year time frame? Is it a five-year time frame? Just -- you're right, we've all been dealing with this before you got there. So it has already been five-plus years. So any sense of direction there?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think, listen, I don't want to -- again, I believe -- in the perfect world, we'd lay out all of our plans for everyone, but we're obviously not in a position to do that. And I think what I would just encourage you to do is look at the things that we've closed. Hopefully, you'll continue to see progress as we look forward, and you'll be able to draw judgments based upon that. And relative to what it means for our business, as I've said, we still have a fair amount of flexibility in order for us to grow fee-based businesses and grow businesses that require balance sheet usage on the asset side.\nSo I think I just can't give you any more specificity other than we don't want to mislead people. And it's not as if we're not thinking about the future. And so again, we try and be very careful not to weigh too much on one side or the other. But we've got a lot of people here that serve customers every day.\nAnd every single person isn't working on a consent order. Many are. We've got a huge amount of resources that are dedicated to it. But as you see, we're building products in the card business.\nWe're building products in our retail services business. We're doing the same across the digital platforms across the company. And so -- and as we execute on these items, you build the confidence of the regulators. So it's not as if you have to wait until everything is completely done to be able to continue to move forward, not just with your confidence, but with their confidence as well.\nSo hopefully, in terms of the progress that we believe we're making, we're -- that's what we're seeing. And so you'll see us put all the resources toward these things to minimize the time frame but get them done properly at the same time that we're moving the business forward.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThanks [Inaudible]\nOperator\nAt this time, we have no further questions. And I'd like to turn the call back over to management.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGreat. Well, listen, thank you all for the time today. We appreciate it.

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please note today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nThank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today with our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, who will discuss fourth-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth-quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today, containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP final measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie. \nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our fourth-quarter results, and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth-quarter results in more detail and some of our expectations for 2023 before we take your questions. Let me start with fourth-quarter highlights.\nOur results were significantly impacted by previously disclosed operating losses, but our underlying performance reflected the continued progress we're making to improve returns. Rising interest rates drove strong net interest income growth. Our continued progress and our efficiency initiatives helped to drive expenses lower excluding operating losses. Loans grew in both our commercial and consumer portfolios, and charge-offs have continued to increase but credit quality remains strong.\nOur capital levels also remained very strong. And our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6%, well above our required minimum plus buffers. We also continue to make progress on putting legacy issues behind us. Our broad reaching agreement with the CFPB in December is an important step forward that helps us resolve multiple matters, the majority of which have been outstanding for several years.\nOver the past three years, we have made significant changes in the businesses referenced in the settlement, and many of the required actions were already substantially complete prior to this announcement. While our risk and regulatory work hasn't always followed a straight line and we have more to do, we've made significant progress, and we will continue to prioritize our work here. In addition to our risk and regulatory work, it's also critical for us to continue to invest in the future as we build off the great market positions we have. We are confident our processes will enable us to continue to prioritize our risk and control work.\nAt the same time, we invest in our future. And as I look back at '22, I'm enthusiastic about the progress we've made this past year and feel even better about the opportunities ahead. Let me start with the changes we've made during the year to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs. These efforts included the elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection, early payday making eligible direct deposits available up to two days early, extra-day grace, giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees.\nAnd in the fourth quarter, we launched Flex Loan, a new digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds. Teams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in record time. The rollout has been smooth and though it's still early, customer response is exceeding our expectations. These actions build on services we've introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking, our account with no overdraft fees.\nWe now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago. We continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions. We continue to improve our credit card offerings including launching two new cards, Wells Fargo Autograph and BILT. Our new products helped drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022, while we continued to maintain strong credit profiles.\nWe launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses, to provide a more comprehensive, relevant and integrated offering for our clients. We continue to enhance our partnership within our commercial business to bring corporate and investment banking products such as foreign exchange and M&A advisory services to our middle-market clients. Our different approach to technology is helping us better serve our consumer and corporate clients. We rolled out our new mobile app with a simpler, more intuitive user experience, which has improved customer satisfaction.\nIn 2022, mobile active customers grew 4% from a year ago. We launched Intuitive Investor, making it easier for customers to invest with the streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investments. And total active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago. We completed the development of Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant that provides a more personalized, convenient, and simple banking experience, which is currently live for eligible employees and set to begin rolling out to customers early this year.\nLast month, we announced Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients. Vantage uses AI and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients' specific needs. Over the past year, our industry-leading API platform team continued the development of payment APIs for commercial and corporate clients invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients, ramps up in group product offerings in consumer lending and began developing commercial lending solutions. We are investing heavily in modernizing the IT infrastructure and the way we develop code.\nWe're implementing a cloud-native operating model that allows us to innovate faster. We've also been investing in modernization in the areas of payments and corporate lending, taking out legacy applications and digitizing processes end to end. These enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of initiatives we have planned as part of our multiyear digital transformation. We also continue to evaluate our existing businesses.\nAs we announced earlier this week, we plan to create a more focused home lending business aimed at serving primarily bank customers as well as individuals and families and minority communities. This includes exiting the correspondent business and reducing the size of our servicing portfolio. I'm saying for some time that the mortgage business has changed dramatically since the financial crisis, and we've been adjusting our strategy accordingly. We're focused on our customers, profitability, returns, and serving minority communities, not volume or market share.\nThe mortgage product is important to our customer base and the communities we serve, so it will remain important to us, but we do not need to be one of the biggest originators or services -- servicers in the industry to do this effectively. Across all of our businesses, we must evolve as the market regulation and competition has evolved. And while it may seem counterintuitive, we believe the decision to reduce risk in the mortgage business by reducing size and narrowing our focus will actually -- this will actually enable us to serve customers better and will also improve our returns in the long term. Changing gears now.\nI'm proud of all we did last year to make progress on our environmental, social, and governance work. We are balanced in our approach to these issues and believe that thinking broadly about our stakeholders will enhance returns to shareholders. And we provide many examples on Slide 2 of our presentation. So, let me just highlight two examples here.\nWe published our first diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which highlights the progress that we've made on our DE&I initiatives. We'll continue to make progress in our commitment to integrating DE&I into every aspect of the company under the new leadership of Kristy Fercho, who joined Wells Fargo in 2023 to lead our home lending business and was named the company's new head of diverse segments, representation, and inclusion in the fourth quarter. We've commissioned an external third-party racial equity audit, and we plan to publish the results of the assessment by the end of this year. 2022 is a turning point in the economic cycle.\nThe Federal Reserve has made clear that reducing inflation is its priority, and it will continue to take actions necessary to achieve its goal. We are starting to see the impact on consumer spend, credit, housing, and demands for goods and services. But at this point, the impact of consumers and businesses has been manageable. And though there will certainly be some industries and segments of consumers that are more impacted than others, the rate impact we see in our customer base is not materially -- I'm sorry, the rate of impact we see in our customer base is not materially accelerating.\nThis plus the strength with which consumers and businesses went into this slowing economy is a helpful set of facts as we look forward. Our customers have remained resilient with deposit balances, consumer spending and credit quality still stronger than pre-pandemic levels. As we look forward, we're carefully watching the impact of higher rates on our customers and expect to see deposit balances and credit quality continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels. While we're not predicting a severe downturn, we must be prepared for one, and we are stronger company than one and two years ago.\nOur margins are wider, our returns are higher, we're better managed, and our capital position is strong, so we feel prepared for a downside scenario if we see broader deterioration than we currently see or predict. We still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as we make progress on our efficiency initiatives and continue to make the investments necessary to grow the business through technology and product enhancements. Two years ago, we shared a path to higher ROTCE by returning capital to our shareholders and executing on our efficiency initiatives. While high levels of operating losses in the second half of '22 impacted our results, our underlying business performance demonstrated our ability to improve our returns.\nIn a moment, Mike will highlight the key drivers of our path to a 15% ROTCE, which we believe is achievable based on the strength of our business model and our ability to execute. While we're focused on improving our returns, making progress on building the appropriate risk and control and infrastructure for a company of our size and complexity will remain our top priority, and we will dedicate the time and resources necessary. I want to conclude by thanking our employees across the company who are working hard each day to continue to make progress in our transformation. I'm excited about all that we will accomplish in the year ahead.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie. And good morning, everyone. Slides 2 and 3 summarize how we helped our customers, communities and employees last year, some of which Charlie covered. So, I'm going to start with our fourth-quarter financial results on Slide 4.\nNet income for the fourth quarter was 2.9 billion, or $0.67, per diluted common share. Our fourth-quarter results included 3.3 billion, or $0.70, per share of operating losses primarily related to a variety of previously disclosed historical matters, including litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation. $1 billion of impairment of equity securities, or 749 million after noncontrolling interest, predominantly in our affiliated venture capital business, primarily driven by portfolio companies in the enterprise software sector. Both, slowing revenue growth rates and lower public market valuations of enterprise software companies impact the valuations.\nIt's important to note that even after recognizing this impairment, the current value of these investments at the end of 2022 remained above the amount of the initial investment. $353 million of severance expense, primarily in home lending. While we've reduced headcount in this business throughout 2022, this charge includes the actions we plan to take in 2023 related to the mortgage announcement we made earlier this week. These reductions were partially offset by 510 million of discrete tax benefits related to interest and overpayments in prior years.\nWe highlight capital on Slide 5. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6%, up approximately 30 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the benefit from our fourth-quarter earnings, the annual share issuance for our 401(k) plan matching contribution, and an increase from AOCI. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect. As a reminder, our G-SIB surcharge will not increase in 2023.\nWhile we have not repurchased any common stock since the first quarter of 2022, we currently expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of this year. Turning to credit quality on Slide 7. Credit performance remained strong with 23 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows, and we expect them to continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels over time as the federal needs to take actions to combat high inflation.\nCredit performance remains strong across our commercial businesses with only 6 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Total consumer net charge-offs increased 88 million from the third quarter to 48 basis points of average loans, driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the credit card portfolio but remained slightly below consumer net charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2019. Nonperforming assets increased 1% from the third quarter as lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans were more than offset by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans. Our allowance for credit losses increased 397 million in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth, as well as a less favorable economic environment.\nWe are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risk and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards. Let me highlight trends in two of our portfolios. The size of our auto portfolios declined for three consecutive quarters, and balances were down 5% at the end of 2022 compared to year-end 2021. Meanwhile, originations were down 47% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago which reflected credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates.\nOf note, our new vehicle originations surpassed used vehicles in the fourth quarter, reflecting a combination of credit tightening actions that we've implemented and the industry dynamic of higher new vehicle sales growth. Turning to the commercial real estate office portfolio. The office market is showing signs of weakness due to weak demand, driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance, as well as challenging economic and capital market conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to significant loss content yet, we do expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure and being disciplined in our underwriting standards with both, outstanding balances and credits down compared to a year ago.\nOn Slide 8, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 3.1 billion from the third quarter. Period-end loans increased for the sixth consecutive quarter with growth across our commercial portfolios and higher consumer loans driven by credit card and residential loans, partially offset by continued declines in our auto portfolio. I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results.\nAverage loan yields increased 181 basis points from a year ago and 85 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher rate environment. Average deposits declined 6% from a year ago and 2% from the third quarter. Compared with the third quarter, we saw declines in each of our business. Lower consumer balances reflected customers continuing to reallocate cash in higher-yielding alternatives, particularly in wealth and investment management and continued consumer spending.\nAs expected, our average deposit cost increased 32 basis points from the third quarter to 46 basis points, driven by higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Average deposit costs are up 44 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021, while market rates have increased substantially more during that same time. As rates continue to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase in customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products to continue. Turning to net interest income on Slide 9.\nFourth-quarter net interest income was 13.4 billion, which was 45% higher than a year ago, as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. I'll provide details on our 2023 expectations later on the call. Turning to expenses on Slide 10. The increase in noninterest expense from both, a year ago and from the third quarter was driven by higher operating losses.\nExcluding operating losses, other noninterest expense was flat from a year ago as higher severance expense was offset by lower revenue-related compensation and continued progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our operating losses in the fourth quarter included accruals related to the December 2022 CFPB consent order. As part of that settlement, we agreed to one incremental remediation and one new remediation related to overdraft fees. The accrual related to these two remediations was approximately 350 million.\nOur operating losses in the fourth quarter also included accruals for other legal actions. And reflecting these accruals, our current estimate of the high end of the range of reasonably possible losses and accessible for legal actions as of December 31st, 2022, is approximately 1.4 billion. This is down approximately 2.3 billion from September 30th, 2022. While we still have outstanding litigation resolved, this estimate would be the lowest level since the second quarter of 2016, though, of course, new matters will arise and existing matters will develop over time.\nThe estimate for December 31st, 2022, will be updated at the time of our 10-K filing in February and may change. While we acknowledge the elevated level of operating losses, the past two quarters has been significant. They are important steps in putting historical issues behind us as we've been able to absorb the cost while increasing our CET1 ratio as I highlighted earlier. Turning to our operating segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 11.\nConsumer and small business banking revenue increased 36% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates. Deposit-related fees continued to decline as we completed the rollout of the overdraft fee reductions and new product enhancements that we announced early last year to help customers avoid overdraft fees. The majority of the revenue impact of these changes was reflected in the fourth-quarter run rate. We continue to focus on branch rationalization as digital adoption and usage among our customers have steadily increased.\nIn 2022, we reduced branches by 179 and branch staffing levels by 10%, and we expect to continue to optimize our branches and staffing levels in response to changing customer needs. While industry mortgage rates declined in the fourth quarter, they were still up over 330 basis points since the beginning of the year, and weekly mortgage applications as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association were at a 26-year low at quarter end. The economic incentive to refinance is extremely limited. And refinance applications for the industry were down 87% in December compared to a year ago.\nReflecting these market conditions, our home lending revenue declined 57% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and gain-on sale margins, as well as lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. We expect the mortgage origination market will continue to be challenging and gain-on sale margin or remain under pressure until excess capacity industry has been removed. As we announced this week, we will be exiting our correspondent business, which we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter. We don't expect this action to have a significant impact on our 2023 financial results.\nCredit card revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point of sale volume and new product launches. Auto revenue declined 12% from the year ago driven by continued loan spread compression from rising rates and credit tightening actions in certain areas, as well as lower loan balances. Personal lending was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by lower spread compression. While originations grew 19% from the year ago driven by strong consumer demand in investments and the business, we have remained disciplined in our underwriting.\nTurning to key business drivers on Slide 12. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 32% from the third quarter, with both declines in correspondent and retail and originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations were over half of our volume a year ago to -- declined to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2022. I already highlighted the drivers of the decline in auto originations.\nSo, turning to debit card. Spending was up 1% compared to a year ago. Holiday spend for debit card was flat compared to the 2021 season with lower transaction volume, offset by higher average ticket size. Entertainment was the only category with double-digit spending while growth -- while categories such as home improvement, general retail goods, and fuel were all down compared to 2021.\nCredit card spending increased 17% from a year ago, and while the year-over-year growth rate slowed from the third quarter. Almost all categories continue to have double-digit growth. Average balances were up 22% from a year ago. Payment rates have started to moderate, but we're still well above pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to commercial banking results on Slide 13. Middle market banking revenue increased 78% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net gains from equity securities, partially offset by loan growth. Average loan balances were up 18% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, while growth in the first half of 2022 was driven by higher realization.\nUtilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year. Average loan balances have grown for six consecutive quarters and were up 5% in the third quarter, with growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory, which are still below pre-pandemic levels. Growth in middle market banking was driven by larger clients, including both, new and existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller customers. Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 14.\nBanking revenue increased 22% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results due to the impact of higher interest rates, as well as improved lending results. Investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all products and industries. Commercial real estate revenue grew 16% from a year ago driven by stronger lending results to a higher loan balances and the impact of higher interest rates. Markets revenues increased 17% from a year ago, driven by higher trading revenue in equities, rates and commodities, foreign exchange, and municipal products.\nAverage loans grew 10% from a year ago after growing for seventh consecutive quarter, average loans declined from the third quarter as utilization rates stabilized across most portfolios. On Slide 15, wealth and investment management revenue was up 1% compared to a year ago, as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates was partially offset by lower asset-based fees due to the decrease in market valuations. The majority of win in advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so asset-based increased slightly in the first quarter, reflecting the higher market valuations at the end of the year. Expenses decreased 6% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives.\nEven as loan growth in securities-based lending moderated due to demand caused by market volatility in the interest rate environment, average loans grew 1% from a year ago. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Both revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our Corporate Trust business in Wells Fargo Asset Management. We sold these businesses in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in a net gain of 943 million.\nRevenue also declined from a year ago due to lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, including the impairments in equity securities I highlighted earlier. The increase in expenses from a year ago was driven by higher operating losses. Turning to our expectations for '23, starting with Slide 17. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income.\nWe are assuming that -- we are assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Moving from left to right on the waterfall, based on the current forward rate curve, we expect our net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates, even with deposits repricing faster than they did in 2022. However, this benefit is expected to be partially offset by continued deposit runoff and mix shift to higher-yielding products with these declines, partially offset by modest loan growth. We also expect a headwind for lower CIB Markets net interest income due to higher funding costs.\nThis reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in trading gains and noninterest income, so the impact to revenue is currently expected to be small. Putting this all together, we currently expect net interest income to grow by approximately 10% in 2023 versus 2022. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned in 2023 will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix, and pricing in the loan demand. Turning to our 2023 expense outlook on Slide 18.\nFollowing the waterfall from left to right, we reported 57.3 billion in noninterest expense in 2022, which included 7 billion of operating losses. Excluding operating losses, expenses would have been 50.3 billion, which is -- which was in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of last year. If you also exclude operating losses from the guidance, our 2022 expenses were impacted by inflation and higher severance expense. However, revenue-related expenses were lower than expected by market conditions.\nSo, we believe a good starting point for discussion of 2023 expenses was 50.3 billion, which excludes operating losses. We expect expenses in 2023 to increase by approximately $1 billion due to both, merit increases, including inflationary pressures and an approximately $250 million increase in FDIC expense related to the previously announced surcharge. These increases are expected to be partially offset by approximately 100 million of lower revenue-related expense, primarily driven by decreases in loan lending. Based on current market levels, we expect revenue-related expense in wealth and investment management for 2023 to be similar to 2022.\nWe've successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately 7.5 billion of gross expense saves over the past two years. And through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize an additional 3.2 billion of gross expense reductions in 2023. A piece of this is related to the announcement we made earlier this week to create a more focused home lending business, but expense savings from reducing our servicing business will take more time to be realized. We highlighted on this slide the largest opportunities for additional savings this year, and we believe we'll have more opportunities beyond 2023.\nSimilar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work separate from our efficiency initiatives. And we will continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work. And while we continue to focus on executing our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to invest and expect approximately 1.7 billion of incremental investments in our businesses in 2023. As Charlie discussed, investing in our businesses is critical to our growth across the company and better serve our customers, but we'll also continue to be thoughtful and evaluate the level of investments throughout the year.\nSo, putting this all together, expenses, excluding operating losses, are expected to be relatively flat in 2023 compared with 2022, even with inflationary pressures, a higher FDI surcharge, and increase incremental investments in our businesses. As 2022 demonstrated, operating losses can be significant and hard to predict, and therefore, we have not included them in our expense outlook for 2023. However, we currently anticipate ongoing business-related operating losses, such as fraud, theft, and other business-as-usual losses to be approximately 1.3 billion this year, which is the same assumption we provided last year. As previously disclosed, we had an outstanding litigation -- have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact the amount of operating losses.\nIt's important to note that while we made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. This remains a multiyear process with the goal of achieving an efficiency ratio along with our peers based on our business mix. Given how critical continuing to invest to our -- continue to invest in our story, on Slide 19, we provide details on our primary areas of focus for 2023. As we've highlighted, continuing to build the right risk and control of infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work.\nCharlie discussed many of the investments we started to make in digital payments, and we plan to continue to invest in these areas this year to make improvements for both our consumer and commercial customers. We also plan to continue to invest to expand our client coverage and investment banking, commercial banking, and wealth and investment management and to continue to transform our technology platforms, including moving more applications to cloud, consolidating our data centers, and increasing investments in cyber. Finally, by investing in our operations and branches, we expect not only to improve the customer experience, but also improve efficiency, reduce operational risk, and drive and account growth. As we show on Slide 20, in the fourth quarter, we reported an 8% ROTCE.\nBut as I highlighted at the start of the call, our fourth-quarter results were impacted by several notable items, including higher operating losses, elevated impairments of equity securities, severance, and discrete tax benefits. As we show on this slide, you will -- if you exclude these notable items, our fourth-quarter ROTCE would have been approximately 16%. However, we don't believe this accurately reflects our longer-term expectations for the following reasons. Net interest income was higher than our long-term expectations due to interest rates, funding, penalties, mix, and pricing, Also, net loan charge-offs were at historically low levels.\nIf rates, funding balances, mix, and pricing were closer to our long-term expectations and charge-offs were higher, our ROTCE would be lower. Depending on what adjustments you make here, we may all get to a slightly different answer. So, to be clear, because the interest rates are higher and freight costs are lower than our longer-term expectations, we believe we have more work to do to improve our returns. On Slide 21, we highlight our path to higher returns.\nSince we first discussed our ROTCE goal in the earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2020, we have executed on a number of important items. We executed a $20 billion of gross common stock repurchases, 16 billion in net issuances, including our 401(k) plan. We increased our common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.30 per share. We delivered approximately 7.5 billion of gross expense saves and reduced headcount by 11% since the end of 2020.\nSo, we've made good progress over the past two years on things that we can control, and we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher-returning products and businesses. Adding more focus on our home lending business should also be a positive contributor to higher returns. We also have additional opportunities to execute on efficiency initiatives.\nAdditionally, we expect to benefit from the investments we are planning in our businesses, which I highlighted earlier. While some of these investments will be dependent on the market environment, we expect them to increase ROTCE. At the same time, we will continue to prioritize building our risk and control infrastructure. In the longer term, we believe that running a company in a more controlled and disciplined manner will continue to benefit returns.\nAnd our goal is for our four operating segments to produce returns comparable to our best peers. In summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in the fourth quarter significantly impacted our results, the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect an improvement in our earnings capacity. As we look forward, we expect to continue to grow net interest income. And our expenses, excluding operating losses, are expected to be relatively flat even after inflation and incremental investments in our businesses to drive growth.\nBoth our credit performance and capital levels remained strong in the fourth quarter. And we expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter. We will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\nThank you. At this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please stand by for our first question. Our first question of today will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.\nYour line is open, sir.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Good afternoon, I should say. Mike, just a follow-up on the NII outlook for the year.\nSo, you obviously had a good high end to the year at 13.5% FTE. And just looking at what the guide implies a step down -- a little bit of a step down from thereafter, can you just kind of walk us through just how you expect the betas to move through and then like what doesn't necessarily follow through from here in terms of some of the moving parts? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Sure, Ken. Thanks for the question. I'll just kind of walk you through some of the drivers there.\nAnd then, obviously, also the timing of when we expect to realize some of those matters as well. And so, as you look at the key things, you look at stick loan growth, we've got -- we're expecting kind of low to mid-single-digit loan growth throughout the year. So, not super fast pace, but at a moderate pace of loan growth. We are expecting some moderate declines across the deposit base stabilizing later in the year, but some moderate declines as we look over the next few quarters.\nAnd then we would expect the betas to continue to move up a little from here. And then when you think about the pacing of it, the first half of the year will certainly be higher than the second half of the year if all of these things play out. And so, you shouldn't expect a really big step down in the first quarter for sure. And then I think that provides the opportunity potentially in the second half of the year if things -- if we don't see that step down in deposits or the betas are a little bit better than what we expected.\nAnd then I'd just point out is even as we looked at the fourth quarter, betas were a little bit better than what we had modeled. And so, we're all in a little bit of uncharted territory here, but I do think that there's some opportunity potentially in the second half of the year as we look at the forecast, but it will be dependent upon how we fare over the next quarter or two.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. And so, second question, I heard your commentary about the 1.3 billion of op losses and the fact that the RPO is down to way down to 1.4 billion. Just how do you kind of help us understand your range of confidence? Obviously, last year, op losses ended at 7 billion as you made progress.\nSo, how wide the range of expectations around your confidence on that level of op loss for the year?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think if you look at what we've said over the last quarter or two, there's been roughly in the third and fourth quarter 200, 250 just BAU op losses that have happened, just broad normal stuff that you should expect to continue. So, that gives you sort of a bottom end. And then I think the rest of it is -- will be a little dependent upon how we work through the rest of the issues that we've got to work through for next year. But I think as you look at the RPL going from 3.7 billion to 1.4 billion, as those big items have moved to be more probable and estimable for us, we booked them.\nAnd hopefully, that gives you confidence that we're putting some of the big things behind us. But we still have stuff to work through, and there'll be more over time, I'm sure. But we've put a lot of big things behind us.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK, great. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nAfternoon, guys. Excuse me. Thank you for taking the question. I think maybe a question along the same lines there.\nSo, the tone around the regulatory issue certainly sounds better than like 90 days ago and that reasonably possible losses seems to have a better quantitative thinking as well. But what -- maybe, Charlie, what are the major touch points sort of on your plate right now? I know all roads ultimately lead to lifting of the asset cap, but maybe would be curious to hear your thoughts on just sort of the biggest things left in your mind.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Well, let me just -- so, listen, we still have a series of consent orders, of which, and I always point this out, the asset cap is a piece of one of them. So, all roads don't lead to the asset cap. The roads in this respect lead to us building the proper control environment, which will satisfy ultimately all the consent orders.\nAnd I've tried to be clear that we are making progress on that work. It is a lot to do. And our tone hasn't changed relative to the confidence in the progress that we're making there. So, we're going to continue doing it.\nAnd hopefully, it's done to the satisfaction of the regulators, but they'll have to decide that. And as we continue to tick off the to-dos on that work, the control environment gets better and better. And we become a better run company that doesn't have those kinds of operating losses that you've both seen in the past.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK. All right. Perfect. And then, Mike, when you talk about resuming share repurchases in the first quarter, maybe you can give us sort of a sense for sort of magnitude and maybe just an even higher level, sort of how you get comfortable repurchasing in the face of what same sort of still uncertain rules out there.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I would start with where our CET1 ratio is at the end of the year at 10.6%. So, we're well above our current regulatory minimum and the buffers that are included there. So, we have plenty of flexibility regardless of any outcome that comes out of the new rules that will be proposed. And keep in mind, that will take some time to come out and get implemented and phase in.\nAnd so, there's -- it's not going to happen in a day. And I think we'll go back to what we've been saying the last number of quarters as we think about the buffer that we'll put on the reg minimum, buffers of 9.2%, we'll be managing somewhere in the 100, plus or minus, a little basis point range. And depending on what happens with loan growth and RWA growth that we see in the quarter, that will help guide the share repurchases.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nPerfect. OK. Thank you, guys, very much.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHey, Mike, I wanted to clarify your answer to Ken, about the first quarter NII. I think you said you do not expect a big step down in the first quarter. Maybe you could just frame first quarter NII a little bit for us relative to the 13.4. What are some of the headwinds, tailwinds? And what might you expect at this point?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Thanks, John. Well, first, you have to normalize for a couple less days in the quarter. So, that's going to be a step down of, call it, 150 million to 200 million step down just there from the flex days.\nAnd then as you look at -- it should be relatively stable to the fourth quarter, but there could be some -- little bit of wiggle room in there.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nStable minus including the day count or --\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYou got to take the day count -- adjust for the day count.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nAnd then stable.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYou have to -- reducing for the day count. Yeah.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. And then, Charlie, maybe a bigger question, just kind of where are you on the efficiency journey when we think about 50 billion of core expense for this year. And the timeframe for ROTCE, what will it take? Is there an efficiency ratio we should keep in mind? Or is that too hard to forecast? Maybe a little bit on that would be helpful.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo, it's a good question. I think -- so, first of all, I think when -- just make a -- just a couple of comments around the expense guidance we gave. Embedded in that expense guidance, we're still continuing to reduce the core expenses of the company. But as you can see on that slide, we're anticipating that we will spend more money on investments that are around technology, digital, building out products, and things like that, that offset that some extent to get to an overall flat expense base.\nMike did say in his comments, and I just want to repeat it, that we're not going to spend this money at all costs. We're going to see how the year continues to pan out. It's money that we would like to spend. We're planning to spend it, but there's a lot of discretion in the expense base.\nSo, we think it's prudent, as we sit here today, to plan to spend it, but we're going to constantly be looking at our performance and make judgments on what that should be. And so, as we look at the efficiency of the company, we do expect to continue to get efficiency ratio improvement in the place. And if we don't see revenue growth and if we don't see payoffs from the things that we're doing, then we will spend less money. And so, that's the way we're approaching it.\nWe're either going to get the efficiency ratio to continue to improve because we're getting real payoff on some things, or we will reduce on a net basis. But overall, there's still gross expenses that should come out of the company, which gives us the latitude to continue to grow the investments inside the company. The timing to get to 15%, listen, it's a great question. As we talked about it, it's medium term, which is obviously not long term or short term.\nBut I would say it's -- without putting a specific time frame, it is -- it should be something that we have in our sights as we look out over the future. It's not something that's theoretical. It's something that we believe we should get to. And just the problem and we're just trying to stay a little bit away from, quantifying exactly where we're starting from just because everyone will make their own adjustments.\nAnd it's just -- I think what we're just trying to do is be really clear that we don't want to take credit for the outperformance in NII. We don't want to take credit for the outperformance in charge-offs, and that we still have to continue to drive improved performance each and every year at the company.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good afternoon. So, Charlie, I was hoping to ask a follow-up to that last line of questioning around expenses. You indicated that the expense work, it's going to continue beyond 2023.\nAnd the one metric that we've been tracking is headcount. And in terms of the benchmarking analysis that we've done, headcount is down more than 10% since the 2020 peek or roughly 30,000, but it's still elevated versus your money center peers. I was hoping you could just speak to what inning you're in currently in terms of optimizing headcount. And whether -- as we look beyond '23, whether there is a credible path to actually driving investments lower, you had talked about balancing investment with the need to drive those efficiency gains.\nI just want to think about the expense trajectory beyond '23, whether further reductions are achievable given some of that inflated headcount still?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Listen, I think -- I mean, I think that your point on headcount versus peers is one that we've made. And so, yes, we are all different in terms of the businesses that we're in and what we do. But we do -- and some insource and some outsourcing things.\nBut when you look at it, we still have higher headcount and higher expenses than people who are more complex than us. You know, some of that is explained by the work that we're doing and the expenses and heads that are building out the control infrastructure, but there's a lot more beyond that. That's the work that we're doing to peel that back piece by piece by piece. We still have a huge amount of manual processes inside the company.\nWe have duplicate systems, and that is -- that's the work that we're on. So, when I say that we still have gross expenses to be reduced in the company, we -- there's -- that's exactly what we're talking about. On the -- the question is when we get to a net basis, where does that come out? As I said before, I think that's a decision that we want to be able to make at each and every point in time when we look at what the overall performance of the company is. So, again, I just want to repeat what I said.\nWe're not going to spend under any environment at all costs. That's not the way we're thinking about it. If we don't see net improvements in performance of the company, we've got the ability to ration back the discretionary spend so that we do continue to see improved performance of the company. What we'd like to see is that these things are paying off.\nWe're seeing real sustainable revenue growth based upon these things and the ability to invest. And so, that's just kind of how -- that's the framework that we're using to make the decisions. And as we get to each point in time, and it's not even just an annual decision. I mean, Mike and I and the operating committee are going to have these discussions regularly about how are things panning out, what does it look like, and how do we feel about our willingness to continue to invest in these things? And have it -- it's got to be living and breathing.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThat's helpful color, Charlie. And for my follow-up, just also as it relates to the discussion around the buyback. You guys are uniquely positioned in that you aren't migrating into a higher G-SIB bucket. Because of the asset cap, you're not going to necessarily see quite as much expansion in terms of balance sheet.\nAnd you've conveyed a high level of confidence around a 15% ROTCE, where your stock is trading today, at least on price intangible, reflects a pretty healthy degree of skepticism and your ability to get there. Just given the strength of your capital position, why not get a bit more aggressive with the buyback here? Just recognizing the significant amount of capital you'll generate, some of the concerns around AOCI seem to be abating. Would be helpful to get some perspective as to whether you might be willing to step it up meaningfully closer to 100% type payout here?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, so just -- it sounds like you're drawing conclusions to the pace at which we said we're going to buy stock back, which I don't think we have actually said. What we've said is that we haven't been buying stock back. We're absolutely -- we anticipate we're going to begin buying it back. As we think about how much we have available in that capacity, what Mike said was our CET1 went up to 10.6%.\nOur required minimum buffers are at 9.2%. And we -- it said that we'll manage 100 basis points above the 9.2% plus or minus. So, we do have substantial capacity but the ongoing earnings capacity of the company. And so, that is -- that's -- our framework is to target a reasonable CET1 ratio.\nIf in the future to raise the levels of capital because of Basel III in-game or whatnot, we've got earnings capacity to be able to do that. But we do have the flexibility. And now that we've got resolution with CFPB and things like that, to be able to go buy stock back. And we'll be making that decision based upon our views on the value of the stock and the liquidity in the market and things like that.\nBut as we said, we do anticipate we'll be back in -- as opposed to where we've been.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nOK. Fair enough. More of my effort to assess the cadence and the magnet, but it sounds like you guys are quite comfortable leaning in here. So, thanks for taking my questions.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nThe next question from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood afternoon. I wanted to see if you could just give a little bit more color on the net interest income side. Maybe if you can talk a little bit more about the noninterest-bearing deposit mix shift that you think could continue here. How -- it looks like that could be a pretty material offset to your interest rate benefits.\nSo, I just wanted to see if you can perhaps talk about that and maybe also help quantify the runoff that you expect to continue on the deposit side in terms of balances overall. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. John, it's Mike. I think overall, as I said earlier, we do expect a moderate decline in balances and some more mix shift changes as we go throughout the year. And so, you should expect that to continue.\nAnd it's all the stuff that should be expected as we're in this environment, and that's what we're seeing. And if you look at each of the businesses, we're seeing it kind of most acutely happen in the wealth business as people move into cash alternatives, out of deposits, and that's what's happening in a lot of wealth management businesses these days as people move that cash around. And then across the rest of the consumer businesses, it's part people looking for higher yields, but it's also part people spending more. And so, you're seeing some of that decline come down as overall balances continue to decline as the stimulus has worn off and people continue to be out there spending.\nSo, it's a little bit of a number of drivers there. And I think as I said earlier, the -- as you think about the NII pacing for this year, this first half of the year will certainly be higher than the second half of the year, given the trends that we expect to happen. And if those are a little bit better than what we're modeling, then I think that provides some opportunity as we look at the second half of the year.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK, Mike. Thank you. That's helpful. And then separately, you gave some pretty good color obviously, around NII expectations now.\nAnd then also on expenses. On the fee side, can you perhaps give us your expectation there around overall growth that you expect in noninterest income and maybe some of the major drivers of where you see growth and if you could possibly size it up perhaps around the investment banking area, etc.? That would help. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. And so, as you break apart fees, the biggest line item there is the investment advisory fees, and that's going to be somewhat dependent upon where the market goes. So, if we start to see recovery in the equity markets at a more substantial pace, that will obviously be a big benefit for that business. When you look at some of the other line items, deposit fees, as I mentioned in my commentary, most of the decline that we were expecting to see as a result of the overdraft policy changes and new products that we implemented is in the run rate.\nYou may see some pressure there related to earnings credit on the commercial side, but the run rate decline for overdrafts is really in there. When you think about investment banking fees, that's going to be somewhat market dependent. We've seen -- it's too early to know how that's going to shape up in terms of the overall industry volume there. But as we continue to make the investments in our investment banking business over a longer period of time, we would expect to see some growth there, both in how we go after that opportunity in the commercial bank and middle market space, as well as our other large corporate clients there.\nAnd so, a lot of that's going to be dependent on the market. But we're confident that we're going to be positioning ourselves better and better to take advantage of it. And then we talked about mortgage. Mortgage is a small piece of the -- it's a much smaller piece of the puzzle than it was today.\nSo, we don't expect that to be --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nA smaller piece today than it was historically.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSorry. Smaller piece today than it was historically. And so -- and that's going to be a pretty challenging market until -- in this rate environment. So, I think we're confident in the investments we're making that will pay off over time, but it may take a little time to start to see some of that come through depending on the market dynamics.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. All right. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the color.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGood afternoon. I just have one question. I guess, Charlie, in your opening remarks, you mentioned that the impact on customers from higher rates, I think you implied was not getting worse with the incremental sales. Was that the right takeaway? And if so, and if the Fed were to stop after another hike, do you actually see that the impact your customers may not be as meaningful as feared over the last six to 12 months and implications of that on the credit quality and the credit performance of your book? Would love to hear any perspective you can share.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. What I was trying to say in those remarks was the impact on rising rates is continuing to impact customers on a period-over-period basis, and we would expect that to continue, but it's not accelerating. It's much more linear than exponential. And the fact that it's much more linear is actually a very helpful thing because that gives people -- that's just -- that's a more orderly transition to a slower growth economy and gives consumers a chance.\nIt shows that they're adjusting their spending patterns and saving patterns and borrowing patterns to adjust for the reality of higher rates. And on your second question, we would anticipate that we would continue to see deterioration in those metrics continue after the Fed stops raising rates, for a period just because of the amount of time that it takes those things to filter through the economy more broadly. So, hopefully, that was helpful.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThat's helpful. And just a quick follow-up. I think you mentioned earlier around commercial real estate. Like are you seeing any stress? There some discussion around the ability of these loans to get refied given the move in rates we've seen over the last year.\nAny steps within the CRE book? And anything just in terms of home state, a lot of negative headlines around San Francisco. Would love to your perspective on that, too.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nIt's Mike. I'll try to take that and Charlie can add if he needs. When you look at the -- and you're really getting at the office, I think, space more than anything there. There's certainly more stress in the office space than there was a quarter or two or three quarters ago.\nAnd I think you're seeing that. Now, it hasn't translated into lost content at this point. And so, we're keeping a careful eye on it. And I think it is -- as you look at where you see it most, it is in older, lower-class properties.\nAnd over 80% of our portfolio is in Class A space. And so, we feel like the quality of it's pretty good, but we will see some stress as we go through here. So far, it's been pretty idiosyncratic in terms of individual buildings and individual places. But we are very watchful on cities like San Francisco, like Los Angeles, like Washington, D.C., where you're seeing lease rates overall be much lower than other cities across the country.\nAnd so, certainly, those are markets that we're keeping a pretty close eye on and making sure we're being proactive with our borrowers to make sure we're thinking way ahead of any maturities or extensions, options that need to get put in place to help manage through it.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\u00a0\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi. Good afternoon. Just one more clarification question, if I may, on net interest income. You know, Mike, your underlying assumptions to your NII outlook in terms of low to mid-single-digit loan growth, moderate declines in deposit balances in the first half and stabilizing, it doesn't feel very different from what consensus had been assuming to get to 51.5 billion for '23, which is clearly higher than what's implied by your outlook.\nSo, I'm wondering if I could reask Ken's question, what deposit betas, what terminal deposit betas, what range of expectations are you baking into that 49.5 billion forecast? And did you make a significant amount of conservatism as you think about your NII outlook? And I'm asking that question because one of your peer CEOs said their 74 billion outlook was not conservative. So, I think that given the outlook versus consensus expectations, I did have to reask that question here.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No, look, it's --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nCan I just ask to start before Mike actually goes to the facts? Again, I think one of the things that you're hearing from all of us that were all very consistent on, which I know you appreciate, but I just want to say it anyway, is we don't know what the rate path is going to look like from here over the next 11.5 months, which is exactly what you're asking and exactly what the competitive environment is going to be month by month versus all of the people we compete with. So, you're looking at -- we don't know what the alternative is going to be in nonbank deposits, and we don't know what the alternatives are going to be in bank deposits, but we're trying to make those predictions. So, I think when we go through all of this, we're all just trying to, in our own way, make sure that there's clarity that we're -- and I'll speak to myself now. We're trying to give you what we think is achievable.\nAnd in our case, based upon the rate curve that we've laid out in the document, and it might or might not turn out that way. We're also assuming, and I talked about this at a conference in December that we are going to continue to raise rates in which we pay our consumers because we're thinking about this not in terms of maximizing short-term NII, but thinking about it in terms of the value of the relationship and making sure that we pay properly for that, so that we're continuing to recognize how expensive it is to get a new relationship and how profitable it can be to keep an existing relationship. And so if your views are different toward the end of the year as to what the rent scenario could be, that's fine. Specifically, what we've tried to do, as we've gotten closer to the periods with which we see is give you some clarity as Mike did on what we're -- the first quarter is a little clearer to us.\nBut beyond that, is pretty difficult, and we're not going to go through every last beta that we're assuming in terms of what those forecasts are.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. The only thing I'd add to it is as you -- as the Fed does -- when the Fed does ultimately peak in terms of rising rates, you will see a lag on pricing as that will continue -- pricing will continue to increase over a quarter or two quarters, three quarters. Really, it all depends on the competitive environment. So, you're going to have some lag there.\nBut I'm sure all of us have our own points of view and assumptions underneath those models. But what we're trying to give you, as Charlie said, is a case that we think is achievable through the year. And as I said earlier on the call, I think if we're -- if we've -- depending on how it plays out over the first and second quarter, we could have some opportunity in the second half. But I think it's unclear exactly how that will play out.\nSo, we'll obviously keep you updated as it goes.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Erika.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question is from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi. Good afternoon.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nI did want to just unpack a couple of things around the correspondent exit and also some follow-up questions as it relates to the mortgage business in general there. I think you mentioned that it's not substantial impact. Maybe you could help us understand revenues, expenses, EPS. I made my own assumptions, but I got a lot of questions from people on what managements say.\nSo, I would like to understand that piece of it. And then could you help us understand how you're thinking about the mortgage business once you exit correspondent, is there any originate and sell servicing retained left in any panel? Or are you staying with this correspondent exit -- your exit that you'll be moving entirely to portfolioing for yourself, and the MSR will wind down over time? Just give us some color around that. It would be appreciated. Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So, maybe I'll start on the second, and then Mike will circle around to the first. So, we are not assuming that we will balance sheet every loan that we underwrite in the future. Again, what we're just -- what we're trying to do in the path that we've laid forward is just to make very clear that we're not interested in running and having a business which is focused on a stand-alone mortgage product.\nWe very much appreciate the importance of mortgage to the consumer base. And we're going to continue to stay in the business. But we're going to view it as part of the importance in the broader relationship. So, that means we'll be originating both, conforming and nonconforming mortgages.\nAnd we'll continue to make the decision as to what goes on our balance sheet as we have done in the past. The fact that we'll be originating a lot less will certainly mean that over time, the MSR and the overall servicing book will come down very naturally based upon that, over a fairly long period of time. But we'll also look for intelligent and economic ways to reduce the complexity and the size of our servicing book between now and then. And if those present themselves, we'll certainly be interested in doing that.\nAnd I know Mike will talk a little bit about this, but I think one of the things we were just trying to say when we think about the size of the impact of exiting the correspondent business immediately is given the fact that mortgage volumes are so low, and revenues are so low. The revenue impact of exiting the correspondent business in the short term is not meaningful. It's a very small number of people. So, that's not all that meaningful in the short term.\nThe real benefit comes over time as we reduce the size of the servicing business, which, as we've tried to make the point is, it's not just reducing expenses, but it's not profitable for us today in a whole bunch of these segments where we continue to have the servicing. And so, it becomes a positive over time. And it's just -- but that is not a short-term benefit for us but certainly a medium- to longer-term one.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And the only thing I'd add is all you lose initially, Betsy, is the gain on sale on the origination. The servicing is still here. And that in any given quarter over the last couple of years is low tens of millions of dollars.\nSo, it's a really small impact.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThe servicing cost is low tens of millions?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThe only thing you lose today by exiting correspondent is the gain on sale on the origination of mortgage.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThe low tens of millions is the gain on sale?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nCorrect.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThe servicing of the existing portfolio is still here and --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nPart of the broader servicing dialogue.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nBecause one of the follow-ups I got was it, does it impact the scale? Obviously, it reduces the flow over existing plants. So, does that matter to how you price your reach?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\n[Inaudible]\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes, I mean --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo, it's not even close. I mean, the amount that we're originating today relative to the scale we have in the business is -- it's immaterial. And we'll -- and even as we downsize the portfolio on the servicing side, the whole point -- our servicing portfolio can be substantially, substantially lower, and we'll still have scale to be able to originate the product and we would say in a more profitable way than we're doing it today.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. So, the remaining mortgage origination channels are 100% retail, is that right?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. Right. Because you're at a wholesale, you're out of correspondent?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. That's correct.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nAll right. Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nThanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Question for you. With the CFPB settlement, there was a comment by the head of CFPB about growth initiatives slowing your progress.\nSo, Charlie, as a question to you is what are you planning to do in regards to that comment in terms of the growth initiatives? Are you trying to slow anything? Any color on that?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I addressed it in my remarks, which is we've been very, very clear. And I think if you look back on every earnings call, let alone any time I speak publicly, we're very consistent in making sure that everyone understands both, internally and externally, that our No. 1 priority is getting that work done.\nThat is how we're running the company. We have very clear processes internally to make sure that, that happens. And we're very confident that's the case. And the things that we are doing to grow the business, we think, are actually helpful to actually making it a more controlled place.\nAnd we're going to continue to go forward the same way we've been going forward, being very conscious of making sure things don't get in the way.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nThanks. A completely different question. On -- in the past, you've given some color on deposits and among different tiers of customers. Any color, any update on where those stand currently and your outlook on that?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nIt's still very much the same, which is kind of intuitive that those who went in with lower balances are the ones who are living more paycheck to paycheck. And they are seeing more stress than those that have not had that. But I would say that it's the rate of change, it's still the same across most of the affluent spectrum. So, the trends are still very consistent.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nThanks.\u00a0\nOperator\nAnd our final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Good afternoon. Charlie, kind of to -- excuse me -- flip this question from your answers to the servicing and the residential mortgage business, are there any lines of businesses that -- I know you can't go out and make an acquisition, of course, but any lines of businesses you're looking to grow and enhance and beef up maybe through hiring groups of people to do that, you know, strategic increase?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nListen, I think when we look at all of the -- I mean, I've said this in the past, when we look at each of these businesses that we have, and that's going to be a consumer bank, it's consumer lending, wealth, commercial and the corporate investment bank. With the exception of the home lending business and that the rest of the consumer lending businesses that lend, it's all going to be based upon returns and what we're seeing in terms of market competitiveness. All of these businesses have the opportunity to continue to grow share. And when we think about the things that we're doing to invest, we are targeting investment banking ads in both coverage and products.\nWe're focused in commercial banking, the build-out of both the corporate investment offerings for that customer base, both the corporate investment bank and the commercial bank of opportunities to continue to improve what we do from the treasury services perspective. And so, we see growth opportunities there. I've talked about the opportunities in our wonderful wealth management business to bring on some more investment teams as we've reoriented that business. And when we wind up looking on the consumer lending side, you've seen growth in the credit card side of the business, which we would expect to continue.\nAnd our consumer bank is -- we very carefully evolve from fixing the problems that we've had, taking advantage of the franchise. So, when we talk about -- and we have this page in the deck, Page 19 in the investor -- in the earnings presentation, we do see multiple places for us to be able to increase the rate of growth by just organically, which sometimes involves adding people. Sometimes it's building technology. Sometimes it's just improved execution.\nAnd there are other things like affluent and whatnot that I haven't mentioned, but they're a bunch, and they're pretty broad.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. And then just as a quick follow-up. Mike, you guys mentioned that there was a private equity or equity write-down in the quarter. Can you share with us how big that was? And then just -- I know over the years, you guys have done very well in this area.\nBut -- and then second, how big is the portfolio? What's the remaining there?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. It was about $1 billion write-down, 750 million after noncontrolling interests. And so, that's on the first page of the release, if you want to refer back. It was primarily driven by some write-downs in enterprise software companies.\nAnd in particular, it was really one investment that drove most of it. And I would just point out, we had a -- that investment is still a very good investment. The company is a good investment, and we're still holding it well above where we -- where the invested amount is.\u00a0\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nJust to be clear, we're holding it at something like still --\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nA little under $0.5 billion.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I would say 10 times what we invested in it.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nBut like all of -- all enterprise software companies, it's the company -- it's just -- it's the rate of growth over the next year or so has come down substantially, but it's still a very high-quality company.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd then just more broadly, on the venture business, we've done -- the team has done a great job over a very long period of time, and we still think it's a very good business.\nOperator\nAnd that was our final question.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nOK. Thank you, all. And we appreciate the time, and we'll talk to you next quarter. Take care, everyone.\nBye-bye.\nOperator\nThank you all for your participation on today's conference call.

[Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to your host, John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks very much, John. Good morning. I'll make some brief comments about our second quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some second quarter highlights. We earned $3.1 billion in the second quarter. Our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to market conditions. Revenue declined as growth in net interest income driven by rising interest rates and higher loan balances was more than offset by lower noninterest income as market conditions negatively impacted our venture capital, mortgage banking, investment banking, and wealth management advisory businesses.\nWe continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives, and our expenses declined from a year ago even with inflationary pressures and higher operating losses. We had broad-based loan growth with both our consumer and commercial portfolios growing from the first quarter and a year ago. Credit performance remained strong. Our allowance reflected an increase due to loan growth.\nWhile we're monitoring risks related to continued high inflation, increasing interest rates, and the slowing economy, which will impact our customers, consumers and businesses have been resilient so far. When looking at simple averages across our entire portfolio, consumer deposit balances per account increased from first quarter and a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels. Overall, our consumer deposit customers' health indicators, including cash flow, payroll, and overdraft trends are not showing elevated risk concerns. However, we're closely monitoring activity by segment for signs of potential stress.\nAnd for certain cohorts of customers, we have seen average balances steadily decline to pre-pandemic levels following the final Federal stimulus payments early last year, and their debit card spend has also been declining. Overall, debit card spending was up 3% compared to a year ago when consumers received stimulus payments. And inflation appears to be impacting certain categories of spending, including a 26% increase in fuel driven by higher prices, while discretionary categories like apparel and home improvement spending were down double digits, driven by fewer transactions. Credit card spend increased 28% from a year ago, above the industry trend driven by the new products we launched last year, with double-digit increases across all spend categories.\nHowever, spending, while still strong, started to slow in May and June. Consumer credit card utilization rates remain below pre-pandemic levels. Payment rates remained strong and delinquency rates remain low. Our small business portfolio continues to perform well in the aggregate in both delinquencies and losses.\nLeading indicators such as payment rates, deposit levels, utilization, and revolving debt trends do not yet indicate signs of stress. Loan demand from our commercial customers remain strong with broad-based balance and commitment growth. Our commercial customers' credit performance remained strong with exceptionally low net charge-offs, and nonaccrual loans were at their lowest level in over 10 years. However, we are monitoring early warning indicators across portfolios including cash flow activity, credit line utilization rates and industry fundamentals for inflation impacts.\nNow let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Our work to build an appropriate risk and control infrastructure is ongoing and remains our top priority, but we also continue to invest in our businesses to better serve our customers and to help drive growth. This week, we launched our fourth new credit card offering in the past year, Wells Fargo Autograph. Our latest card reflects our momentum in growing our consumer credit card business with new accounts up over 60% from a year ago.\nWe're focused on delivering competitive offerings, and our new reward card provides three times points across top spending categories including restaurants, travel, and gas stations. This is the first of several rewards-based cards we plan to introduce. We continued to improve the digital experience in the second quarter with the relaunch of Intuitive Investor, our automated digital investing platform. We simplified the account opening process and created a faster and better experience for both new and experienced investors.\nDuring the second quarter, we began rolling out Wells Fargo Premier, which provides differentiated products and experiences focused on strengthening and growing our affluent client relationships. We are working toward offering one set of products and services that are tailored to the needs of these customers regardless of where they sit within our individual businesses. We will be rolling out more enhancements in the coming quarters to provide a more compelling offering for premier clients. We started to roll out overdraft policy changes late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions.\nAdditional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, including providing customers who overdraw their account with a 25-hour grace period to cure a negative balance before incurring an overdraft fee, giving early access to eligible direct deposits, and providing a new easy short-term credit product. We expect these changes will help millions of consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs, and we continue to review other ways we can help consumers manage their finances. We also continue to invest to better serve our commercial customers. And early in the second quarter, Tim O'Hara joined the Corporate and Investment Bank from BlackRock as head of banking.\nTim's expertise and insights will help us maximize our potential and achieve even greater partnership and strategic dialogue with our corporate and institutional clients. And he complements the strong leadership team in our markets and commercial real estate businesses, who have helped us navigate recent market volatility. We believe we have a significant opportunity to serve our existing commercial customers with corporate and investment banking products in a way that works within our existing risk tolerance. We also believe that for us to be successful as a company, we must consider a broad set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions.\nLast week, we announced that Otis Rolley will be joining Wells Fargo from The Rockefeller Foundation as the head of social impact, leading community engagement, and enterprise philanthropy, including the Wells Fargo Foundation. We continue to move forward in the area of ESG with the announcement of our 2030 reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions attributable to financing activities in the oil and gas and power sectors. As homeownership remains out of reach for too many families, we announced an effort to support new home construction, renovation, and repair of more than 450 affordable homes across the U.S. in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity and Rebuilding Together.\nWe also launched our special purpose credit program to help minority homeowners refinance mortgages that Wells Fargo currently services. We continue to support our small business customers through this time of uncertainty, including launching the Small Business Resource Navigator, which connects small business owners to potential financing options and technical assistance through community development financial institutions across the country. We are also helping women entrepreneurs by doubling our support for women-owned businesses through the Connect to More program with complementary mentorship opportunities. We published our inaugural diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which highlights the meaningful positive results we've made on our DE&I initiatives.\nFor example, in the U.S., our external hiring of individuals from racially or ethnically diverse populations increased by 27% in 2021 compared to 2020, and approximately one-third of all internally promoted executives last year were racially or ethnically diverse. As I've said in the past, advancing DE&I at Wells Fargo is a long-term commitment, not a project, and we continue to pursue many of the initiatives in the report and look for ways to deepen our impact. Let me just make some summary comments before turning it over to Mike. The Federal Reserve's commitment to an aggressive rate hike cycle as a means to tame high persistent inflation continues to fuel market volatility and is expected to slow the economy, which will impact our consumer and commercial customers.\nDespite the economic environment, I remain optimistic about our future. Credit quality remains strong, and we expect net interest income growth to continue given rising interest rates, which should more than offset any further near-term pressure on noninterest income. We remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past, on a run rate basis in the second half of this year, and then we will discuss our path to 15%. This year's Federal Reserve stress test confirmed our strong capital position and our ability to support our customers and communities while also continuing to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases.\nAs we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 20% to $0.30 per share, subject to approval by the company's board of directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.1 billion or $0.74 per common share, which included strong growth in net interest income as we are beginning to see the positive impact of higher interest rates. Our results included a $576 million impairment of equity securities, predominantly in our venture capital business due to the market conditions, which drove a total loss from equity securities of $615 million in the second quarter. Recall that a year ago, when the markets were strong, our results included $2.7 billion of gains on equity securities.\nWhile credit quality remains strong, our results included a $235 million increase in the allowance for credit losses due to loan growth. This follows 6 consecutive quarterly decreases in the allowance, including $1.1 billion in the first quarter and $1.6 billion a year ago. We highlight capital on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, down approximately 20 basis points from the first quarter as declines in AOCI and dividend payments were largely offset by our second quarter earnings.\nOur CET1 ratio also reflected actions we took to proactively manage our level of capital and risk-weighted assets as well as reduce our AOCI sensitivity by moving more securities to held-to-maturity and hedging securities in our available-for-sale portfolio. Additionally, we did not buy back any shares in the second quarter. But as Charlie highlighted, the recent stress test results confirmed our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders through dividends and common stock repurchases. We will continue to be prudent and consider current market conditions, including interest rate volatility, potential loan and risk-weighted asset growth as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters.\nOur 10.3% CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers. As a reminder, based on the recent Federal stress test, our stress capital buffer for October 1st, 2022 to September 30th, 2023 is expected to be 3.2%, which would increase our regulatory minimum plus buffers by 10 basis points to 9.2%. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5. Our charge-off ratio remained near historical lows and was only 15 basis points in the second quarter.\nAs we previously discussed, losses are not expected to remain at these low levels. And we are closely monitoring our commercial and consumer customers for signs of stress, and we remain very disciplined in our underwriting. Commercial credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses with only two basis points of net charge-offs in the second quarter, which included net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio. We also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios, and total consumer net charge-offs declined slightly from the first quarter to 33 basis points of average loans, as lower losses in auto and other consumer loans were partially offset by higher credit card losses.\nNonperforming assets decreased $878 million or 13% from the first quarter. Lower levels of consumer nonaccruals were driven by a decline in residential mortgage nonaccrual loans due to sustained payment performance of borrowers after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Commercial nonaccruals continued to decline, and as Charlie highlighted, we are at their lowest levels in over 10 years. Our allowance for credit losses at the end of the second quarter reflect a continued strong credit performance, with an increase that was due to loan growth.\nOn Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 3% for the first quarter. Period-end loans grew for the fourth consecutive quarter and were up 11% from a year ago, with increases in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing operating segment results.\nAverage loan yields increased 19 basis points from a year ago and 27 basis points from the first quarter, reflecting the benefit of higher rates. Average deposits increased $10 billion or 1% from a year ago, with growth in consumer banking and lending, offsetting declines across our other operating segments. The decline in average deposits from the first quarter reflected seasonality of tax payments as well as outflows from commercial and wealth clients. Our average deposit cost increased one basis point from the first quarter, driven by corporate and investment banking.\nAs I previously highlighted, we would expect deposit betas to accelerate as rates continue to rise and customer migration from lower-yielding to higher-yielding deposit products would likely increase as well. Turning to net interest income on Slide 7. Second quarter net interest income increased $1.4 billion or 16% from a year ago and $977 million or 11% from the first quarter. The growth from the first quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgage-backed securities.\nWe also benefit from higher loan balances and one additional day in the quarter. We started the year expecting full year net interest income to grow by approximately 8% compared with 2021. Last quarter, we raised our guidance to an increase in the mid-teens. With the market now expecting not only more rate hikes but also larger ones, we currently expect net interest income in 2022 to increase approximately 20% from 2021.\nAnd as a reminder, net interest income will ultimately be driven by a variety of factors, including the magnitude and timing of Fed rate increases, deposit betas, and loan growth. On Slide 8 in noninterest income. This quarter, noninterest income -- this quarter, we included highlighting noninterest income to show that the decline from both the first quarter and a year ago was primarily driven by two cyclical businesses. Mortgage banking, which has slowed in response to higher interest rates, and our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, which a year ago generated elevated gains but recognized impairments in the second quarter of this year due to significantly different market conditions.\nWhile all other noninterest income included both positive and negative impacts, it was actually up slightly from the first quarter. The decline in all other noninterest income from a year ago was primarily driven by the impact of last year's divestitures. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined 3% from a year ago as expenses related to divestitures came out of the run rate, and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives.\nOperating losses increased $273 million from a year ago, primarily driven by increased litigation expense, which included a recovery in the second quarter of last year and higher customer remediation expense predominantly from a variety of historical matters. Customer remediation matters are complex and take a significant amount of time to resolve and quantify the full impact. While we've made progress, we have more to do to resolve the remaining items. We're halfway through the year.\nAnd while we've had higher operating losses than we expected, revenue-related expenses are trending lower than expected. Our results in the first half of the year also reflected the progress we're making on our efficiency initiatives with lower headcount and reductions in both professional and outside services expense and occupancy expense. We expect to continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Putting all these factors together, we still expect our full year 2022 expenses to be approximately $51.5 billion as lower revenue-related expense is expected to offset higher operating losses.\nBut as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory matters, and customer remediations, and the related expenses could be significant and hard to predict, which could cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion outlook. Turning to our operating segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 10. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 17% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances. Our deposit pricing has been stable, but we expect deposit betas to increase over time.\nAs Charlie highlighted, the deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we started to roll out late in the first quarter, which included the elimination of fees for non-sufficient funds and overdraft protection transactions. Additional changes will be rolled out in the second half of this year, which will further reduce deposit-related fees. On lending revenue declined 53% from a year ago and 35% from the first quarter driven by lower mortgage originations and compressed margins given the higher rate environment and continued competitive pricing in response to excess capacity in the industry. After increasing over 150 basis points in the first quarter, mortgage rates increased over 100 basis points in the second quarter.\nThe impact of higher rates also reduced revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. The mortgage market is expected to remain challenging in the near term, and it's possible that we have a further decline in mortgage banking revenue in the third quarter. We are making adjustments to reduce expenses in response to lower origination volumes, and we expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters. Credit card revenue was up 7%, auto revenue increased 5% and personal lending was up 7% from a year ago, primarily due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Our mortgage originations declined 10% from the first quarter, with growth in correspondent partially offsetting the decline in retail originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations declined to 28%. Average home lending loan balances grew 2% from the first quarter, driven by the fourth consecutive quarter of growth in our nonconforming portfolio, which more than offset declines in loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs.\nTurning to auto. Origination volume declined 35% from a year ago and 26% from the first quarter due to increased pricing competition, credit tightening actions, and an ongoing industry supply pressures. Turning to debit card. While debit card spend increased 3%, transactions were relatively flat from a year ago as increases in travel and entertainment were offset by declines in apparel and home improvement.\nCredit card point-of-sale purchase volume was up 28% from a year ago with the largest increases in fuel travel and entertainment. The increase in point-of-sale volume and the launch of new products helped drive a 19% in credit card -- 19% increase in credit card balances from a year ago. We remain disciplined in our underwriting and new credit card accounts. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 12.\nMiddle market banking revenue increased 27% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income from the impact of higher rates and loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances. Noninterest expense increased 2% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs. Efficiency initiatives drove lower personnel expense with headcount down 9% from a year ago.\nAverage loan balances have grown for four consecutive quarters and were up 13% from a year ago. Utilization rates continue to increase, but they are still not back to historical levels. Clients have increased borrowings to rebuild inventory and to support working capital growth, both of which have been impacted by higher inflation. We also had momentum from adding new clients in middle market banking and similar to prior periods, loan growth was driven by the larger clients.\nAverage deposits declined 2% from a year ago driven by actions to manage under the asset cap. Deposit pricing has been relatively stable, but we expect deposit betas will continue to increase. Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily driven by stronger treasury management results given the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances.\nInvestment banking fees declined, reflecting lower market activity and a $107 million write-down on unfunded leveraged finance commitments due to the market spread widening. Average loan balances were up 20% from a year ago, with broad-based loan demand driven by a modest increase in utilization rates due to increased working capital needs given inflationary pressures. Commercial real estate revenues grew 5% from a year ago, driven by loan growth and higher interest rates. Average loan balances were up 22% from a year ago with the disruption in the capital markets increasing demand for bank financing and line utilization.\nMarkets revenue increased 11% from a year ago, primarily due to higher foreign exchange and commodities trading revenue as clients position themselves for rising rates, quantitative tightening, and growing recessionary concerns as well as higher equities trading. Average deposits in corporate and investment banking were down 14% from a year ago, driven by continued actions to manage under the asset cap. There's been more deposit pricing pressure in corporate banking than we've seen in commercial banking. On Slide 14, wealth and investment management revenue grew 5% from a year ago as the increase in net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances more than offset the declines in asset-based fees, driven by lower market valuations as well as lower retail brokerage transaction activity.\nAs a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second quarter results reflected market valuations as of April 1st, and third quarter results will reflect the lower market valuations as of July 1st. The S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the second quarter, and approximately two-thirds of our advisory assets are in equities. So there will be another step-down in our asset-based fees next quarter. Average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending.\nAverage deposits declined 1% from a year ago and were down 7% from the first quarter as clients reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Deposit pricing increased modestly. Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Both revenues and expenses declined from a year ago and were impacted by the divestitures of our corporate trust services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management and the sale of our student loan portfolio.\nThese businesses contributed $580 million of revenue in the second quarter of 2021, including the gain on the sale of our student loan portfolio. And they accounted for approximately $375 million of the decline in expenses in the second quarter compared with a year ago, including the goodwill write-down associated with the sale of our student loan portfolio. The decline in revenue in corporate was also due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In summary, while our net income in the second quarter declined driven by lower venture capital and mortgage banking results, our underlying trends reflected our improving earnings capacity with expenses declining and strong net interest income growth from rising rates and higher loan balances.\nAs we look ahead to the second half of the year, we expect the growth in net interest income to more than offset any further pressure on noninterest income. While we expect credit losses to increase from historically low levels, our consumer and commercial customers are not showing any meaningful signs of stress. As I highlighted earlier, our expense outlook for the year is unchanged at approximately $51.5 billion subject to the risk to the outlook discussed earlier. Finally, our stress test results demonstrated our capacity to return excess capital to shareholders, including the expected 20% increase in our third quarter common stock dividend subject to board approval.\nWe will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] And our first question today will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning, guys. I appreciate the continuity of the expense guide and also the potential variability. Mike, I was just wondering if you could expand on that.\nObviously, the operating losses are hanging higher this year than they had been. So just wondering how you start to get a sense of what those look like going forward? And then also just the underlying, as you mentioned, coming in better because of revenue, just any sense of all -- just how your net saves are looking underneath the surface as well. Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Thanks, Ken. First, I'd start with the efficiency program that we've been talking about now for the better part of a year and a half. And all of that's tracking as we thought it would.\nSo the core driving kind of efficiency through the core business lines and operating groups is sort of working the way we thought. When you look at what's happened this year, as you pointed out, operating losses are higher than what we assumed at the beginning of the year. And those things just can be unpredictable at times just as we work through the backlog of items. You know the accounting standard we work with, right? If we knew about something now, we would accrue for it.\nIf we could estimate it, we would accrue for it. But we're just flagging -- continuing to flag that we still have a pipeline of stuff to work through. And then as you highlighted, as we think about this year, the increases in the operating loss line have been offset by -- largely offset by the lower revenue-related expenses. And so we still feel good about that $51.5 billion number that we set out at the beginning of the year.\nAnd we're going to continue to work through the pipeline of items. And if something is significant in comps, we will be sure to highlight it as we go forward.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nYes. And as a follow-up, I know as you guys talked through the recent conference season, it's hard to get a crystal ball with so many moving parts as you think about 2023. But can you just help us try to at least start to think through some of the pushes and takes? And can you continue to push this toward getting costs down next year? Thanks, guys.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Ken. This is Charlie. Let me take that. The way we think about it is as we sit and look toward next year, we certainly know we have some increases to contend with, such as the full year impact of inflationary pressures that we see this year.\nAnd we know we've got some increases in FDIC insurance premiums. But as we start thinking about next year and we're really just starting the budget process, our mindset going into it is that we have significant opportunities to become more efficient. We've been -- and it's just more of the same in terms of what we've been talking about. And this has nothing to do with getting efficiencies out of the risk-related work, it assumes that all of that investment continues.\nBut we do go into this process with the expectation that we want to see net expense reductions. Now just usual caveats, that excludes revenue-related expenses, which could go up or some of this -- the lumpiness that we've talked about. Just as we think of -- but as we think about that core expense base, we do continue to see opportunities, and we'd like you to see it as well.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about capital. It looks like you're entering next quarter with over 100 basis points buffer to your pro forma reg minimums.\nHow should we think about where you'll manage capital to and your potential buyback capacity going forward? And given that you paused for SCB partly because of SCB uncertainty, will you get to some level of buybacks likely moving forward here? Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYep. Hey, John. It's Charlie. Why don't I start and then Mike can chime in.\nYes. I mean I think your -- no question, we -- clarity of SCB for us at this point does really help. As we sit here today and we look at what's happening in spreads and what's happening with the 10-year that was at 2.92% right now. But we do want to be a little bit just conservative in terms of how we think about managing the capital base.\nSo just to be -- I think to be clear, as we sit here today, we're very happy with the amount of capital that we have, including as we think about that 10 basis points increase that will impact us. We certainly have capacity to buy shares back at this point. And as I think Mike alluded to, we just probably want to wait a little bit just to see what happens in terms of the volatility in spreads and rates before we start to do that. But we certainly, at a point, will do it.\nWe'll just see exactly when that is.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Maybe I'll just add one or two things, John. I think as Charlie highlighted, we feel good about where we are. I would just point out, we are not -- our G-SIB score is going to stay the same as we go into next year as well.\nSo we don't have another uptick as we go into the beginning of next year. So that's good. And at this point, we don't feel like we need to build capital from where we are to build a bigger buffer. And then we'll just be prudent on buybacks as we go through and through the next few quarters.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And Mike, maybe I can ask a follow-up on the NII revised outlook. What kind of cadence do you see between the next two quarters? It seems like you'd have a big step-up both this coming quarter and the third quarter and then again in the fourth. And then within that NII equation.\nIf you still have this funding gap between loan growth being very strong and deposit growth slowing, is there still plenty of cash to use to fund the loan growth? Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, sure. I think, ultimately, the exact progression over the next couple of quarters will be a function of how the Fed moves on rates. But I would think of it as somewhat of a ratable step-up quarter to quarter. So not -- you won't see some outsized results in one versus the other as we go.\nAnd you'll continue to see a little bit of loan growth come through. We think that probably moderates a little bit from what we saw in the first half of the year, but you'll see some loan growth there as well as it steps up. And as you say, I think the industry has seen deposits come down a little bit. If you look at the latest version of the Fed data and you can see that in our results as well.\nNow for us, it's been a little bit of -- you can see the period-end balances in each of the segments, and there's been a little bit of reduction in each of them with the lowest-percentage reduction being in the consumer space. So that's a good thing. And as you know, we -- over the last couple of years, we've brought down much of our wholesale funding that we've got out there. And so we've got plenty of capacity to provide liquidity or get the liquidity we need to continue to support clients.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nSo that loan growth funding is coming from your cash balances and other sources of liquidity that you have?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYep. Exactly.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHey. Good morning. So I wanted to start off with a question just clarifying some of the NII guidance. Mike, because you noted that it's a ratable step-up and it imply -- the guidance implies about a $12 billion run rate, at least in the back half for NII on an FTE basis.\nIs it reasonable for us to assume or expect that the exit rate for the year is going to be north of $50 billion? I just want to make sure I clarify that.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, Steve, I know you're really good at modeling this stuff. So I'll let you do the modeling. But I think as you pointed out, we're going to see step-ups, right, as we go through the next -- as we did this quarter from last quarter. And that will continue into the third and fourth quarter.\nAnd now exactly what -- it's hard to use one quarter, as you know, to adjust run rate for the rest of the -- for the following year. But certainly, the exit rate is going to be a lot higher than even where we are today. And then we'll have to just see what the environment is like at that point in how to think about whether that's a clean run rate to build off of or are there other things that get in the away. And as you can see, over the last -- even over the last three, four, five, six weeks, whatever it's been, the amount of volatility that's out there on the long end and what happens with loan growth, does it keep at the same pace, and so there's a lot of factors, I think, that go into what 2023 would look.\nBut as you pointed out, our exit rate will be pretty healthy.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThanks for that, Mike, and just for one follow-up also on the NII guide. Just wanted to get a better sense as to what's being contemplated in terms of deposit beta. The deposit paydown and repricing just came in much better than peers this quarter. You've cited the benefits of the deposit and funding optimization you've executed these past few years.\nJust wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about that deposit trajectory that's underpinning some of the NII guidance.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean I think that's -- we're not expecting balances to grow much from where they are. And I think we'll see what happens as -- if we see continued outflows of deposits. But as you pointed out, like our mix of deposits as we came in this environment sets us up pretty well, and you can see that in the results so far where the consumer deposits are a much bigger percentage of the overall pie than they were just a couple of years ago.\nAnd as you sort of think about betas, so far, they've basically progressed as we thought in each of the segments. And so we really haven't seen much variation to what we thought at this point in the rate cycle. Now if the Fed does raise rates 75 basis points at the next meeting, now you're starting to get into territory that we didn't see in the last rate cycle -- rate rising cycle. And so we're going to start to see betas increase from there.\nAnd I think that's -- exactly at what pace and where you need to be defensive or not on the wholesale side of the -- on the commercial side, we'll see. And we're pretty nimble and are able to react to it. But so far, everything has progressed as we thought it would. And so we're going to keep a pretty close eye on it as we go over the next few months.\nAnd I think that will -- this quarter and into the fourth quarter, I think, will give us a lot of interesting data points to know how to think about it over a longer period of time.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nGreat color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator\nThank you. Our next question comes from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nMorning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. Just as it relates to revenues overall, the NII trajectory, obviously, quite strong and in a sense, seems mostly self-evident for now. But I was hoping, Mike, you could discuss please the sort of the fee trajectory in a bit more detail.\nI guess we're kind of hovering in a $7 billion or $7.5 billion a quarter range if we exclude some of that noise from the equity marks, the securities gains, etc. In your mind, are we sort of at a low, and can we grow from that base? I know you touched on mortgage maybe coming down then we've got wealth. But just sort of puts and takes as you see that, if you could, please?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, sure. Thanks, Scott. I'll just bring you through some of the key fee lines just to give you a sense of some of the dynamics, right? So on the deposit side, it's been pretty -- we saw a step-down in the quarter, largely a result of the changes we made in overdraft fees. We'll see a little bit more step-down as we go through the year, probably more a fourth quarter thing than a third quarter thing, as we implement the additional changes there.\nBut there's -- other than that, there's a lot of stability generally to that line based on underlying activity. We'll see what happens in the market and how that drives the investment advisory and asset-based fee line. That's -- it's going to be key to see what happens in the equity and the fixed income markets. And as we bring -- as more stability enters into the market, that really supports that fee line.\nAnd as you know, that's our single biggest line item as you look at that fees. Investment banking. It's really going to be market driven, but we -- our fees were pretty low, including the small mark that we had on -- in leveraged finance. And so it's hard to see that going too much lower, but that's really going to be driven by the activity levels.\nCard spend, we're seeing still good. Although it slowed maybe a little in May and June, we're still seeing really good activity in the card space and people are out spending. So that's helpful. Mortgage banking, as you highlighted, I think, is likely going to come down a little more in the third quarter.\nBut it's off a much smaller base, and you can still have pretty big -- you can have decent-sized percentage declines there. But it's still -- it's really small dollars at this point. And then we'll see as the market progresses and how that impacts the equity security side, but -- so I think hopefully, we're getting more stability here, but some of it will be dependent upon what we see in the markets.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nAll right. That's perfect. Thank you very much. And if I could switch gears just a bit back to sort of CCAR and the SCB.\nI guess it's possible I had sort of misinterpreted your guys' remarks over the last few quarters. But I sort of felt like you guys were maybe prepping us for possibly somewhat worse outcome in terms of where the SCB would flush out. In your mind, how did that CCAR and the -- that SCB, just because it's barely budged, right? So how did that all flush out relative to what you guys have kind of been anticipating?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. What we said a couple of times was that we thought it was possible that it was going to increase, and it did. Now you have to keep in mind like we only have so much visibility into the underlying drivers of what causes it to go up or down in any given year. Now there's a lot of stuff that's public, but there's also a lot of the modeling techniques that aren't quite easy to understand.\nAnd so I would say we were pleased with the result, and we spent -- as many do probably, we spend a lot of time on trying to understand the drivers of the risk to the balance sheet and do our best to have positioned ourselves for good outcomes. And so we were pleased that -- where it came out.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK. All right. Perfect. Thank you guys very much.\nI appreciate it.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning, John.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nJust on the -- just on the deposit front, just to go back to that. I just want to confirm. So from here, your best estimate now is that overall deposit balances are relatively stable in the back half of the year? Or do you think you could see some incremental declines just as betas were rising?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nI think you can certainly see a little bit more decline from here potentially. I think that's not an unreasonable expectation. Exactly timing and how that's going to progress, I think it's hard to predict with any real degree of accuracy just given the environment we're in right now. But I think it's possible they come down a little bit more from here.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. All right. Thanks, Mike. And then on the credit front, I want to get your thoughts on the likelihood of reserve bill.\nI know you added to the reserve for loan growth this quarter. But in terms of an overall build of the reserve as you -- from a CECL perspective, as you look at your economic scenarios, where do you see this quarter with your CECL scenarios that didn't warrant a sizable build? And I guess, longer term, as this plays out and we see the Fed continue to tightening, what do you view as a potential level that you may have to bring the reserve to? Is a pandemic level too high? And maybe you can help us with the magnitude there?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, as you think about the process we go through, which I think is similar to most in a lot of ways, you're really looking at a number of scenarios that you need to be thoughtful about and include in your modeling. And we've now, for a number of quarters in a row, have had a significant weighting on the downside scenario already. And some of those scenarios are pretty severe, right? And so you've got weightings on what some might term wild recession, more severe recessions, so you could create a lot of labels for them. But it's a number of scenarios that have different severities of downside.\nAnd so we feel at this point that we've captured what we can look at and see or anticipate at this point based on all the factors that we need to evaluate in our current reserves. And I'll just point out also, as you look at us in the position we're in, yes, we didn't take down all of the reserves that we put up during COVID. And so as you sort of look through each of the underlying asset classes, we feel what we have today is appropriate. It's hard to see in the near term increasing them to the level that we had back in the pandemic.\nBut I think that's a hard thing to see at this point. But I think we'll have to make sure as things evolve throughout the next couple of quarters, we'll have to incorporate that. But again, we already have a pretty significant weighting on those downside scenarios already. And it's a very -- as you would imagine, a very robust conversation that we go through each quarter to evaluate how we feel about it.\nAnd at this point, we feel it's appropriate for what we can see over the life of those loans.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. All right. One more related to on credit quickly. The $107 million write-down in unfunded leveraged finance commitments that you took, is there a risk of future marks there? Is that primarily just predicated on market spreads? And then separately, what is your -- can you remind us what's your total leveraged loan exposure both in terms of commitments and outright outstandings? Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. We don't -- you got to think of these as unfunded commitments, not funded, right? So as you sort of think about them, don't think about them outstandings. Think about them as unfunded commitments, number one. And you really have to, over time, think about term loans versus high yield a little bit differently.\nAnd on the high-yield side, we don't disclose this but -- we haven't disclosed the actual number. But it's really small in the scheme of the balance sheet in the term loan side, which generally has a little bit more stability to it and less volatility to it is the bigger part. All these deals are subject to further spread widening, given the environment we're in, for sure. We, at the end of the quarter, took our best -- used our best judgment to market where we thought the deals would clear.\nAnd we'll see how that goes over the coming months.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. Great. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHey. Good morning. I just had one more follow-up question. And Mike, I apologize if this is the umpteenth question on NII.\nI appreciate all your color in terms of what's driving the NII guide of 20%. I was wondering if you could better quantify the deposit beta that you would expect by year-end on a cumulative basis. Appreciate that you said it would accelerate. But given that some of your peers have given specific guides and given how much the quality of your deposit base has changed for the better over the past several years, I'm wondering if you could give us a sense of what that beta range that you're assuming by year-end on a cumulative basis that underpins that guide?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Yes, Erika. I think that's a really hard thing to give a pinpoint number on at this point in the cycle, to be honest with you. And if you think about -- and it's -- there's so many moving pieces right now, I think, between -- and particularly as you sort of get to year-end and the pace of rates and what exactly is the Fed going to do and when are they going to do it.\nAnd so I think there's a lot that goes into that, that trying to get a one number is a hard thing to say with a lot of confidence, in my view. I think what we can say though is as you look at the next couple of rate rises, I think you're going to start to see more acceleration. On the retail and the consumer side, the core rates haven't changed much for the big banks at this point yet. So you'll start to see that happen over the next couple of rate rises.\nThe betas will still be pretty small. However, that will start to pick up depending on how fast the Fed goes by year-end. And then I think on the other side of the spectrum on the corporate investment bank and those deposits, whether it's in the FI space or the large corporate space, you're seeing those betas pick up a lot already. So those will continue to accelerate.\nAnd so when you look at cumulative betas, you really have to look at -- and you start to compare different banks, you're really going to have to look at the mix of the deposits. And the CIB deposits are just a much smaller piece of the pie for us right now. And those are going to -- those will probably move faster than even we've modeled, but it's a small piece of it. So I think we'll see how it goes, and we'll give you as much insight as we can.\nBut I think trying to predict cumulative betas by year-end is hard.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. I understand. Thanks so much.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHey. Good morning.\nOperator\nFrom Bank of America.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGood morning. Just following up on that, Mike. So I appreciate you don't want to get pinned down on deposit beta. But is it fair for us to assume just given the mix shift in deposits, given how you managed the balance sheet during the pandemic, we should see your deposit beta at least track in line or maybe even lower relative to the last rate cycle?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think we've -- as you think about each asset, each type of deposit, to date, they're tracking pretty close to what we saw last cycle. But you then look at the mix of our deposit base, and that's what's changed pretty substantially since the last go around. And so if betas stayed the same as last cycle by product, given our mix has changed, you would see a lower average deposit beta. But there's a lot to play out as we go through the rest of the year but -- in each of the underlying products.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThat's fair. I just wanted to make sure we weren't missing something because there are peers who probably are expecting a higher beta than last cycle. So I just wanted to hear you talk through that. And as a follow-up, and I know these are extremely tough in terms of when you think about the market -- private market valuations on your equity investments.\nBut give us a sense of just where the markets are in terms of taking these markdowns. Should we anticipate some more negative marks in a world where there's no big turnaround in equity markets over the next few quarters? I just want to make sure like expectations are level set for that line and how that impacts fees and PPNR.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Sure. And again, it really all depends on what happens in the public equity markets, which is in part driving those declines. If we see some stabilization, that's constructive.\nIf we see much deeper declines, that -- we'll have to evaluate how that impacts these portfolio investments. And obviously, if the market starts to rally, that's even more constructive. So I think the public equity markets and -- will be a good guide to how to think about whether or not we have to evaluate whether there's more reductions here or not.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. And it looks like we're tracking to a 15% drop, say, maybe by the end of the year. That was a statement. I don't expect you to respond.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo problem. I'm glad you made it rhetorical.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Mike, can you give us some color on you guys had some good success in the quarter in generating gains from your trading activities and your debt securities.\nCan you just share with us what drove that and what your expectations might be in the next quarter or two?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I mean on the trading side, it was really good performance in our macro fixed income businesses, commodities, FX, a little bit of rates. And so I think that's all what contributed to it. And we'll see, obviously, the continued performance there.\nIt's subject to what we see happening in the markets. It's not -- we're not out there taking any kind of incremental risk than we normally take. It's really helping clients facilitate the flow that they've got there, and so we'll see how that goes. And as you can see, it's a relatively smaller number for us versus maybe some others.\nAs you think about the securities portfolio, I wouldn't assume there'll be continued gains there. I think we did do a small remixing of our securities portfolio. Some of it was RWA. Some of it was RWA optimization.\nI think selling some UMBSs, buying Ginnies that -- where spreads were pretty tight at the time we did it, you save on RWA. You don't give up much yield. And there are a few other minor optimizations we did there.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. And then as a follow-up question, when it comes to your professional and outside services expenses, can you frame out for us how much of that is tied to your current working with the regulators to lift the asset cap in the cease-and-desist order? When that day eventually arrives, will the professional and outside services numbers really have a kind of meaningful downward move because you've resolved that issue?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThis is Charlie. Let me take a shot at this first. Listen, I think we have -- the work we're doing on all of the risk and infrastructure work, which supports the regulatory matters, it's our own headcount. It's professional.\nIt's a bunch of technology work. It really cuts across a whole series of lines. And I just don't really think it's the right time for us to start even talking about where those saves could come from. And it's just genuinely not on our radar screen in terms of what we're thinking about, where it's going to go or anything like that.\nSo I'd rather just defer the question at this point.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nNo problem. Understood. And then Mike, just coming back to your comment about the mix of deposits, and this is a rhetorical question as well. As we see, for the first time in 15 years, consumer deposits in a higher rate environment will make guys like you guys stand out maybe over some of your peers.\nSo good luck with that. Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, Gerard.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHey, good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nCharlie, I think you recently mentioned that you're in the process of strategically thinking about where mortgage fits in. And I guess I wanted to understand what kind of framework you're assessing mortgage under. What you're thinking about that?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Yeah. And that was, by the way, not meant to be a new comment. That's something that we've been doing ever since I got here, and we brought a new management, including Kristy Fercho, who runs the business.\nAnd I mean, if you just go back and look at how big we were in the mortgage business, we were a hell of a lot bigger than we are today. And so we have been all along just reassessing what makes sense for us to do, how big we want to be both in the context of what our focus should be in terms of our primary focus should be on service -- serving our own customer base. And then to the extent that we have efficiencies, it makes sense for us to do other business. But I guess my point was we're not interested in being extraordinarily large in the mortgage business just for the sake of being in the mortgage business.\nWe're in the home lending business because we think home lending is an important product for us to talk to our customers about. And that will ultimately dictate the appropriate size of it. And so I would just -- when you look at how much we're originating versus the size of our servicing business, the servicing business over time will become smaller. And I think that's a smart and good thing for us for many reasons.\nAnd as I said, we're just going to -- we're going to focus on products that make sense for us in the context of where we can make money over the cycles, given all of the complexities and all the requirements that banks have that not necessarily everyone else have and make sure we're getting the right returns for it.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes. So is this a migration toward originate and retain and the mortgage servicing line goes away as an income statement item because it becomes nonmaterial? Or is there some middle ground that you're looking to?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nNo, yeah. No. I would -- I mean, listen. We're still -- I would still assume that a substantial amount of our mortgage production would be eligible for sale.\nAnd whether it's through the agencies or through public market, that's all options that we want to continue. And so we'll still be originating mortgages across the spectrum. Some of which, we'll keep on balance sheet when it makes sense. And others of which, we'll sell and we will have an MSR.\nAgain, if you just look at how much we originated historically versus what we're originating today, it will naturally just come down over time.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThen two other questions. One, I think you recently announced a change in your consumer head. Could you speak through the rationale for that? And what the wish list is for your new head of consumer?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So Mike Weinbach, who had come in to run our home lending businesses, put a whole series of things in place, including if you look at the leadership across all of our card business, our home lending business, our personal lending business, and our auto business. All those -- that's an entirely new management team, plus new heads of -- I can go through all the other functions as well. And Mike put that in place, and we talked about it and he wanted to do something different.\nAnd so we're lucky enough to have a gentleman, Kleber Santos, who joined us a year and a half to two years ago. Background was he was at Capital One prior to that and McKinsey prior to that, and Kleber and I have worked extremely closely together. I'm just thrilled to have him in that role. And so I think I wouldn't expect to see significant changes in the things that we've spoken about.\nWe're focused on continuing the product build-out. On the credit card side, again, focusing on customers that are broader customers in the franchise. Building our customer service around that and building out our digital capabilities and all the other parts of the business, which is work that we have underway. So I don't anticipate any material changes from where we are, just the continued trends and the things that we've been talking about.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGreat. And then just lastly on wealth. It's an important part of your offering. I'm wondering what you're doing to strategically enhance that offering to your clients, be it either through product or how you're structured, integration with consumer, your IT platform and solutions.\nCould you just give us a couple of bullet points on what's going on there?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Let me start, Mike. And Mike and I are both very involved in these conversations with Barry and his team. I think if you look at our wealth business, it's run entirely different today than it was several years ago.\nWe had separate platforms historically here between our brokerage business. We had two different private banks that operated under two different brands. We had our bank channel. And then completely separately, we had a digital platform, and we had a platform or advisors that wanted to go independent.\nThe digital platforms and the platform for independent advisors had very little investment in it. And those would run -- but all of those businesses, they were run as separate businesses with separate product platforms and separate technology. And so what we've done is we now have one set of products and service capabilities that all of those product lines have access to. And we've combined the entire field under one leader.\nAnd we're investing in our digital capabilities, and we're investing in the capabilities of those that want to go independent. So if they want to do that, they can stay here as opposed to elsewhere. We are building out capabilities across all the dimensions, from the investment capabilities to the banking capabilities, our lending capabilities, offering trust in the other areas of distribution that didn't have access to those in the past. And so it's a huge set of changes, which also bring with it a set of changes in the back end, which we're going to move -- we're moving toward common platforms.\nAnd it's something we're really excited about, and we're just at the beginning of seeing the benefits of it. And I think it's one of the things that will make us appear to -- for our financial advisors, to be an extremely attractive place to be, whether they want to be an employee and work for Wells Fargo or they want to be independent and access our capabilities.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. And that change to moving to common platforms, what's the timing of that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. It's not a technology move. I think he's talking about platforms in terms of the overall sort of the way we operate business. So there isn't -- it isn't dependent upon a big technology conversion, Betsy.\nSo -- and then I would just highlight one last thing. Charlie, in his prepared remarks, talked about Wells Fargo Premier. That's step one in really helping provide a more differentiated and holistic service offering to our affluent clients in the consumer business. And the wealth piece is going to be a big part of that.\nAnd we already have 1,500-plus advisors in the branch system to do it. We already have a great investments platform. And so we're in the early days but building out a differentiated service offering there as well, which will be a big part of the wealth businesses going forward.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. And that's in conjunction with consumer business?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nCorrect.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I would say -- yes, just to expand even further, Betsy. It's really a combination of the advisors and the products that Barry has to offer in our wealth management business. It is also leveraging the lending products that Kleber is now responsible for, including credit card and including mortgage and potentially, auto and some other things there, and an integrated offering with Mary's bank customers who are affluent.\nSo it's an offering across all of our product sets directed in a much more segmented way than we've ever done in the past. And so we're extremely excited about it, and we'll be talking more about things that were -- capabilities that we're going to be rolling out throughout the year.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThanks for taking my questions. Charlie, I just wanted to follow up on your question or your comment about loan growth likely to moderate from the first half. Any color on that? What do you think drives that moderation? Which categories?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nVivek, it's Mike. I'll -- maybe I'll take a shot at that. Look, we've just seen -- I just don't think what we've seen in the second quarter will continue to happen at the same pace. We may get surprised, and it will be a little better than we think.\nBut I think at some point, we just feel, as you look at any of the uncertainty that might be there or other factors that are causing clients to use their lines today, that just may moderate as we go through it. I wouldn't look at it as some big warning of anything to come. It's just we're being a little prudent in terms of the way we think about that growth rate. And maybe we'll be surprised on the upside a little, but it's just what we're seeing there right now.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nSo you're not seeing any signs like sort of late in the quarter, I think, already starting to show some slowdown or some conversations with clients that are indicating that? Is that --\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nNot that I would say are super significant at this point. But when you go category by category and say, OK, will spending in the card space continue to increase at the same pace given some of the uncertainty in the economic environment? We'll see, maybe. Commercial real estate, certainly, given what we're seeing in the real estate market there, that appears like it will slow down a little bit again in the second half of the year, somewhat driven by what we're seeing in the capital markets side of that business as well. And so with the slowdown in deals happening and rates rising, that just is a natural slowdown there.\nAnd so I just think you go asset class by asset class, it just feels as though we'll see a little bit of moderation as we go through the rest of the year.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. And one minor one, Mike, for you. The hung loan loss number that you gave us, was it a gross mark or is it net of fees?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThe loan -- the leveraged finance one, Vivek?\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nYes. Yes.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThat's after fees.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThat's after fees. OK. So then what's the gross mark on that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nI don't have the exact number in front of me. It's not materially different.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. All right. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. We have time for one more question today, and that will come from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nHi. I was wondering if you could remind us the targeted customer within credit card as you lean into that business. And do you think about maybe slowing from the expansion plans there, just given all the recession talk and fears?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. This is Charlie, Matt. First of all, our targeted customer, those that we want to have a broader relationship with, what we have said is that as we've rolled out this new product set when you look at the credit quality of the borrowers and the spenders that we have been giving our new cards to, the credit quality is actually stronger than it had been historically. And it still is either on target or stronger than we would have modeled for when we rolled the products out.\nIt's just we're not competing on credit terms. We're not competing in any way, shape or form in terms of that. We just want to have a quality offering, and we would expect it to be a high-quality card customer that we can do other things with across our franchise.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nAnd just any disclosure on FICO scores in terms of either the overall portfolio or the customer that you're growing or leaning into?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, I think you can get some of that in the Q, Matt. You got to go a little deep into the Q, but you can get some of that in the distribution tables in the Q.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. I'll look for it there. Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAll right, everyone. Thank you very much. We appreciate everything, and we look forward to talking to you all. Take care.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nVivek Juneja -- J.P.

{"date": "Oct 14, 2022, 10:00 a.m. ET", "exchange": "NYSE: WFC", "q": "2022-Q3", "ticker": "WFC", "transcript": "Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nWelcome and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo third quarter 2022 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John and good morning, everyone. I will make some brief comments about our third quarter results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I will then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with the third quarter highlights.\nOur solid business performance this quarter was significantly impacted by $2 billion or $0.45 per share in operating losses related to litigation, customer remediation and regulatory matters primarily related to a variety of historical matters. As you know, we have been and remain focused on increasing our earnings capacity and see the positive impact of rising interest rates, driving strong net interest income growth and our continued focus on improving operating efficiencies, resulting in lower expenses, excluding operating losses. Credit quality remains strong and we continue to invest in our technology platforms, digital capabilities, and delivering additional products to our customers and clients. While we are closely monitoring trends with economic conditions expected to weaken given inflation, geopolitical instability, energy price volatility, and rising interest rates, our customers continue to be resilient with overall strong credit performance and solid cash flow.\nWhen looking at simple averages across the entire consumer portfolio, deposit balances per account decreased from the second quarter, but were still higher than a year ago and remained above pre-pandemic levels. However, we continue to closely monitor activity by segment for signs of potential spreads and for certain cohorts of customers. We have seen average balances steadily decline and are now below pre-pandemic levels and their debit card spend continues to decline. This is a continuation of what I referenced last quarter, but it's important to note that this remains a small percentage of our total customer base.\nOverall, our consumer deposit customers' health indicators, including cash flow, payroll, and overdraft trends, are still not showing elevated risk concerns. Debit card spending remained significantly above pre-pandemic levels and was up 3% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, consistent with the second quarter increase. Entertainment and fuel spending had the largest increases from a year ago, but the recent decline in fuel prices drove fuel spending to decline compared to the second quarter. Apparel and home improvement spending declined from both the year ago and second quarter.\nCredit card spend remained strong in the third quarter, up 25% from a year ago, with double-digit increases coming across all spending categories. Spending was up modestly on a linked quarter basis. So remember, the significant portion of this growth is from our new products, which continued to have strong credit profiles. Period-end commercial loan balances were stable compared to the second quarter, with continued growth in commercial banking, offset by declines across our businesses in corporate and investment banking.\nCredit performance remained strong, with net charge-offs and non-accrual loans continuing to decline from exceptionally low levels. Clients do tell us that they continue to be impacted by persistent inflation, rising interest rates, and tight labor market. And while credit quality remains strong, we are actively monitoring inflation-sensitive industries and taking proactive actions where warranted. Now, let me update you on the progress we are making on our strategic priorities.\nWe continue to devote significant resources to implementing an appropriate risk and control framework across the company and this remains our top priority. We continue to make progress and are executing on our plans, but significant work remains. As a reminder, though I am confident in our ability to complete the work, it remains a significant body of work and the primary focus of the company. We have set high standards for success and given the long-standing nature of much of our work, we have said that we remain at risk of setbacks until it is complete.\nExpenses in the quarter reflect these ongoing risks and our efforts to resolve them. As we continue our work to put our historical issues behind us and to address issues that are identified as we advance our risk control infrastructure work, outstanding issues still remain that will likely result in additional expense in the coming quarters, which could be significant. We are working to close these as quickly as possible and we remain committed to doing right for our customers and working closely with our regulators and others to resolve these matters. We recognize the importance of moving forward and the expenses in the quarter are representative of these efforts.\nAt the same time, we are implementing changes to better serve our customers and investing in our businesses to help drive growth. As part of the announcement we made earlier this year to limit overdraft-related fees and give customers more options to achieve their financial goals, we implemented extra day grace period for the third quarter, which provides consumer customers an extra business day to cure negative balances and avoid overdraft fees. We also began to roll out early payday, which provides consumer customers who receive eligible direct deposits the ability to access funds up to two days earlier than scheduled, further reducing the potential to incur overdrafts. Notably, while this enhancement was rolled out in only six states in the third quarter, during the first two weeks of offering this enhancement, we provided customers early access to $2 billion in funds from 1.3 million eligible direct deposits.\nAnd we are on track for a fourth quarter rollout of an easy-to-access short-term credit product that will give qualifying customers another option to meet their personal financial needs. These actions build on services that we have introduced over the past several years, including offering an account that does not charge any overdraft fees. We now have over 1.6 million of those clear access banking accounts, up 57% from a year ago. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have developed a new integrated banking, lending, and investment offering that is geared toward the more complex financial needs of our affluent clients called Wells Fargo Premier.\nDuring the quarter, we introduced Wells Fargo Premier across our entire branch footprint, initiated a branded digital experience, and launched marketing programs to help affluent customers learn more about how we can better serve them. We will continue to build the Wells Fargo Premier offering in a tough in the coming quarters. In the third quarter, we continued to launch new APIs, providing our commercial and corporate clients more flexibility and helping them drive efficiencies. For example, we launched a new real-time payment API allowing clients to send digital requests to a payer that can be approved to easily send a real-time credit transfer.\nWe also launched a virtual card API, which enables clients to create and configure virtual cards for B2B vendor payments and purchases. In our CIB Markets businesses, we are accelerating our investment into our electronic trading capabilities across multiple asset classes to better meet the evolving needs of our clients, which is helping to drive strong gains in trading volumes. And we are selectively adding talent in our investment banking coverage and product areas as we focus on leveraging our strong existing relationships to build our fee-based businesses. We also continued to make progress on the environmental, social, and governance work that is underway at Wells Fargo.\nIn the third quarter, we published our latest ESG report, which highlights the progress we made in 2021 on our ESG efforts. We consider this work a sustained long-term commitment and believe Wells Fargo is well-positioned to make a difference. We issued our second sustainability bond in the amount of $2 billion that will finance projects and programs supporting housing affordability, economic opportunity, renewable energy, and clean transportation. During the third quarter, we officially launched a new grant program in Houston, San Diego, and Milwaukee to help improve racial equity in home ownership and we have more markets coming before the end of this year.\nThis is part of the $60 million commitment we made earlier this year through the Wells Fargo Foundation to wealth opportunities restored through home ownership or worth. This effort aims to create 40,000 homeowners of color access -- 40,000 homeowners of color across 8 markets by the end of 2025. We announced a $1 million donation to provide urgent relief to Florida following the aftermath of Hurricane Ian. In addition, customer accommodations and employee support are available to those directly impacted by the storm.\nIn summary, continued high inflation has kept the better reserve aggressive with rate hikes, leading the housing market to slow rapidly and the heightened uncertainty about the economic outlook and geopolitical events caused the financial markets to be volatile. However, labor demand remains robust, consumer balance sheets remain healthy, and customers have capacity to borrow. Wells Fargo is positioned well as we will continue to benefit from higher rates and ongoing disciplined expense management. Both consumer and business customers remain in a strong financial condition and we continue to see historically low delinquencies and high payment rates across our portfolios.\nWe are closely monitoring risks related to continued impact of high inflation and increasing rates as well as the broader geopolitical risks and we do expect to see increases in delinquencies and ultimately, credit losses, but the timing remains unclear. As we look forward, we remain bullish on our business opportunities. Our higher operating margins and strong capital ratios have prepared us for a wide range of macroeconomic scenarios. In the third quarter, we increased our common stock dividend by 20% and our CET1 ratio was 10.3%, 110 basis points above our current regulatory minimum, including buffers.\nWe will continue to prudently manage our capital levels to be appropriately prepared for slowing economy and market volatility. Finally, I know many of you are interested in our 2023 expectations and on our next earnings call, we plan to provide our 2023 expense and net interest income outlook as well as more color on our path to an over the cycle of 15% ROTCE. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning everyone. Net income for the quarter was $3.5 billion or $0.85 per diluted common share. As Charlie highlighted, our results included $2 billion or $0.45 per share of accruals primarily related to a variety of historical matters. These accruals drove our total expenses higher.\nHowever, if you exclude operating losses, our expenses would have declined as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Revenue grew in the third quarter, driven by higher net interest income, while non-interest income also increased from the second quarter. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was 20.2%. We highlight capital on Slide 3.\nOur CET1 ratio is 10.3%, down six basis points from the second quarter as the 21 basis point decline from AOCI as well as the impact from dividend payments was nearly offset by our third quarter earnings. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect. As a reminder, our GSIB surcharge will not increase in 2023. We did not buy back any common stock in the second or third quarters and we will continue to be prudent regarding the amount and timing of any share repurchases.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5, credit performance remained strong, with only 17 basis points of net charge-offs in the third quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows and we expect them to continue to normalize toward pre-pandemic levels over time as the Federal Reserve continues to take actions to combat inflation. We are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risks and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards. Commercial credit performance remained strong across our commercial businesses, with only $6 million of net charge-offs and net recoveries in our commercial real estate portfolio for the third consecutive quarter.\nWe also had net recoveries in our consumer real estate portfolios. However, total consumer net charge-offs increased $72 million from the second quarter to 40 basis points on average loans driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the auto portfolio. Higher loss rates on certain auto loans originated primarily in the latter part of 2021 contributed to the linked quarter increase in charge-offs and delinquent loans in the auto portfolio. Lower loan balances also impacted the loss rate, which started -- we started taking credit tightening actions earlier this year, which have improved the quality of 2022 originations.\nAs a result of these actions, increased pricing competition, and continued industry supply chain constraints, the third quarter origination volumes were down over 40% compared to a year ago. Non-performing assets declined again in the third quarter and were down $411 million or 7% from the second quarter and down 20% from a year ago. While commercial non-accruals continued to decline, lower levels of consumer non-accruals were the primary driver of lower non-performing assets due to a decrease in residential mortgage non-accrual loans from the impact of customers' sustained payment performance after exiting COVID-related accommodation programs. Our allowance for credit losses increased $385 million in the third quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth and a less favorable economic environment.\nOn Slide 6, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 11% from a year ago and 2% from the second quarter. Period-end loans increased for the fifth consecutive quarter, but growth slowed as expected, with commercial loan balances holding relatively stable from the second quarter while consumer loans grew driven by credit card and first-lien residential mortgage loans, partially offset by continued declines in our auto portfolio. I will highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results.\nAverage loan yields increased nearly 100 basis points from a year ago and 76 basis points from the second quarter, reflecting the higher rate environment. Average deposits declined 3% from both the year ago and the second quarter, with declines across our deposit-gathering businesses. Compared with the second quarter, Wealth and Investment Management had the largest decline by dollar amount as clients looked for higher-yielding alternatives. Declines in our commercial businesses were driven mostly by outflows of non-operational deposits, which can be more price sensitive and are a less stable source of funding.\nOutflows in consumer and small business banking were driven by continued customer spending and increased outflows from customers seeking higher-yielding products. Our average deposit cost increased 10 basis points from the second quarter to 14 basis points. Pricing has been consistent with our expectations, with deposit costs holding relatively stable in consumer banking and lending, while trending higher across other businesses. As rates continue to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase in customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products to also increase.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide 7. Third quarter net interest income increased $3.2 billion or 36% from a year ago and $1.9 billion or 19% from the second quarter. The growth from the second quarter was primarily driven by the impact of higher rates, which increased earning asset yields and reduced premium amortization from mortgage-backed securities. We also benefit from higher loan balances and one additional day in the quarter.\nThese benefits were partially offset by higher funding costs. In the first 9 months of this year, net interest income was up 19% compared with a year ago. We currently expect full year 2022 net interest income to be approximately 24% higher than a year ago, with fourth quarter 2022 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.9 billion. Turning to expenses on Slide 8, the increase in non-interest expense from both a year ago and from the second quarter was due to the higher operating losses that I highlighted earlier.\nExcluding operating losses, other non-interest expense was down 5% from a year ago as we had lower revenue-related compensation, expenses related to divestitures came out of the run rate and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. Excluding operating losses, our expenses would have been down on a year-over-year basis for six consecutive quarters. Another way you can see the impact of our efficiency initiatives is through lower headcount, which has declined for nine consecutive quarters and was down 6% from a year ago. We have also reduced professional and outside services expense by 10% and occupancy expense by 4% during the first nine months this year.\nThe higher level of operating losses in the third quarter will cause us to exceed our $51.5 billion expense outlook for 2022, which included $1.3 billion of operating losses for the full year. We currently expect our fourth quarter other expenses, excluding operating losses, to be approximately $12.3 billion. As Charlie highlighted, outstanding litigation, customer remediation, and regulatory matters still remain -- that will still remain and will likely result in additional expense in the coming quarters, which could be significant. Turning to our operating segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 9.\nConsumer and small business banking revenue increased 29% from a year ago driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit balances. Deposit-related fees were impacted by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out earlier this year, which eliminated non-sufficient funds and some other fees. The extra-day grace period launched in the beginning of August and early payday begin in select states in mid-September, so we would expect our deposit-related fees to decline further in the fourth quarter. Industry mortgage rates have increased over 300 basis points since the beginning of the year and ended the quarter at the highest level since 2007, driving weekly mortgage applications as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association to a 25-year low at quarter end.\nAs a result, our home lending revenue declined 52% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and gain on sale margins as well as lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. While the mortgage market adjusts to lower volumes, we expect it to remain challenging in the near term and it's possible that we have a further decline in the mortgage banking revenue in the fourth quarter when originations are seasonally slower. We continue to remove excess capacity to align with the reduced demand and expect these adjustments will continue over the next couple of quarters. Credit card revenue was up 8% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, which benefited from higher point-of-sale volume and new product launches.\nAuto revenue declined 5% from a year ago driven by loan spread compression and partially offset by higher loan balances. And personal Lending was 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by growth in origination volumes. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 10. Mortgage originations declined 59% from a year ago and 37% in the second quarter, with declines in both correspondent and retail originations.\nRefinances as a percentage of total originations declined to 16% in the third quarter. Average home lending loan balances grew 2% from the second quarter, driven by growth in our non-conforming portfolio. I already highlighted the drivers of the decline in auto originations. So turning to debit card, while debit card spend increased 3% from a year ago, spending declined 2% from the second quarter.\nAs Charlie highlighted, credit card point-of-sale purchase volumes were up 25% from a year ago, with the largest percentage increases in fuel and travel. Average balances were up 21% from a year ago, reflecting the strong point of sale volume which also benefited from the launch of new products, with new accounts up 11%. We will continue to remain disciplined in our underwriting of new credit card accounts. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 11.\nMiddle market banking revenue increased 54% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 27% from a year ago, driven by higher net gains from equity securities, higher loan balances, and higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Non-interest expense increased 9% from a year ago, primarily driven by higher operating costs and higher operating losses. Average loan balances have grown for five consecutive quarters, and were up 17% from a year ago.\nLine utilization rates were fairly stable relative to the second quarter, inflation and our customers' continued efforts to rebuild inventory as supply chain challenges remain drove the growth in asset-based lending and leasing. Loan growth in the middle market banking continued to come from larger clients, which more than offset declines from smaller clients. Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 12. Banking revenue increased 28% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates as well as higher loan balances.\nInvestment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity. Compared with the second quarter, the increase in investment banking fees was due to the write-down of unfunded leveraged finance commitments last quarter. Commercial real estate revenue grew 29% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances, the impact of higher interest rates as well as improved commercial mortgage bank-backed securities gain on sale margins. Markets revenue increased 6% from a year ago, reflecting volatility and strong client-demanded equities, rates and commodities, and foreign exchange trading.\nAverage loans grew 19% from a year ago, with broad-based growth across our businesses to fund clients' working capital needs, but the pace of growth slowed in the third quarter with average balances up 3% and period-end loans down 3% from the second quarter. On Slide 13, Wealth and Investment Management revenue grew 1% from a year ago as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates offset the decline in asset-based fees driven by lower market valuations. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected the lower market valuations as of July 1st. And while the S&P 500 and fixed income indices declined again in the third quarter, the decrease was not as steep as the second quarter decline.\nSo while there will be another step down in asset-based fees in the fourth quarter it will be less significant than the third quarter decline. Expenses decreased 4% from a year ago due to lower revenue-related compensation. Average loans increased 3% from a year ago driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Slide 14 highlights our corporate results.\nBoth revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our Corporate Trust services business and Wells Fargo asset management. These businesses contributed $459 million of revenue and accounted for approximately $305 million of expense in the third quarter of 2021. Revenue also declined from a year ago due to lower equity gains in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, and given current market conditions, we don't expect equity gains to improve in the fourth quarter. Expenses increased from a year ago due to higher operating losses.\nIn summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in the quarter significantly impacted our results, the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect our improving earnings capacity. We had strong net interest income growth from rising rates, and if you exclude operating losses, our expenses would have declined as we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Both our credit performance and capital levels remain strong. We will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] And our first question for today will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, guys. Mike, I wanted to ask on the expenses. The first -- in terms of the operating losses, I know it's tough to answer, but should we think of the op loss accrual this quarter as you reassessing what you might have to pay in the future, or you got hit with some stuff that you didn't expect and you've already paid up? Is there some combination of those? How should we think about what happened this quarter with the op loss accrual?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, John. It's Charlie. Look, I guess the way I'd describe it is, I mean, like I think you all know the accounting rules on when you accrue things are pretty clear based upon, generally, when you know something or have a pretty good sense that something is going to be done and so it's probable, and you can put an estimate on it. And so as we've said, we've tried to be very, very transparent that there -- that we do have things that will be lumpy, that could be significant.\nAnd it's in our best interest to get as much behind us as quickly as we possibly can. It's what we've been trying to do, both with our work but also the financial impact of these things, and that's what you're seeing in the quarter.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And then maybe, Mike, I could follow up on the non-op expense outlook for $12.3 million in the fourth quarter applies up from the $12.1 million this quarter. Maybe just some context of what's driving that? Is it seasonality? And then can we think of that jumping off point of the fourth quarter as the beginning of annualizing that for next year? And what would be the -- roughly the puts and takes for thinking about next year from the fourth quarter? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No. Thanks, John. And I think when you think about the change from third quarter to fourth quarter, it really is just some seasonal things.\nIf you go back over a long period of time, you just see year-end accruals related to a bunch of different items that sort of end up in the fourth quarter, and so there is no story there other than that. I think we continue to be on track on the efficiency work that we laid out at the beginning of the year, and so you'll see some of that come through those numbers as well in there. As it relates to 2023, as Charlie said in his remarks, we will lay that out in more detail in January.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Maybe a broader comment just on efficiency and where you are relative to your longer-term targets?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No. I think we're right on track on the plan that we laid out, John. And we said we would deliver about $3.3 billion of impact in 2022, and that's -- we're on track to do that.\nAs we -- as Charlie and I both said a number of times, we're not done, and I think there is still more opportunity. And we're going through those conversations as we go through our budget process now, and continuing to unpick the onion around where there is more opportunity. So I think those -- that program will continue to evolve, but we still feel we've got more opportunity to drive incremental efficiency, and we're on track for the things we laid out.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd John, the only thing I would add, because I know it's on a lot of people's minds, is that -- I mean, from our standpoint, there is nothing new in our thinking from what we've talked about last quarter, both in terms of where the opportunities are and how we're thinking about the future. And we just do think that it makes sense when we get to the end of next quarter, when we talk about our path to a 15% sustainable through different cycles, ROTCE, that's also an opportunity to talk more specifically about expenses and how that fits in, including what it looks like for next year. And so by that point, we will have finished our budget process. We will understand all the puts and takes, and be in a really good position to talk about it.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nThanks, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I guess I wanted to ask broadly on NII. Once the Fed stops raising rates, can you sort of discuss broadly how and for how long you could maintain positive NII momentum?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, Scott, I think there is a lot that needs to play out for us to answer that with any degree of accuracy, right, in terms of what we're seeing in the economy, loan growth, what's happening with deposits and so forth. But the only thing I would point out that you do need to keep in mind as you think about it is there will be a lag on deposit pricing, and that happens in every cycle. It happened in the last cycle and will happen again here. Once the Fed stops raising rates, you will see a lag before deposit pricing stops going up, and that's just normal and to be expected.\nAs it relates to overall NII at that point, I think there is a lot of what-ifs that need to go into that scenario. And as we all have seen, even over the last few days, some of those expectations continue to evolve. So -- but I would keep in mind as you think about that, the deposit pricing lag.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nYeah. OK. Makes sense. Thank you.\nAnd just returning to the operating losses for a second, just to help put the $2 billion in third quarter targeting context, just I guess, given the magnitude of charges that Wells had already taken, what -- at this point, what is pushing those losses so high and what could keep them high going forward? And I guess I ask it within the backdrop of I know, like, you guys weren't really there when these issues took place. But just given how high they have been for so many years, just curious like what's keeping them at such a level?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Scott, this is Charlie. I'll take a shot at it, and Mike, feel free to pipe in. Listen, I think, again, if you go through things that we've said in the past and go through our disclosures, we still have open regulatory matters that do relate to the past.\nWe do have litigation that relates to a series of those things, which we do cover a lot of it in our disclosures. And the other thing which I just -- as we continue to make progress and move forward and build the control environment, we do find things ourselves that do relate to the environment that we've had in the past, and those things have to be remediated. So as I said earlier, we would like to get both -- just both operationally and financially, things done as quickly as we can. The accounting rules dictate on when you -- whether it's appropriate to take the charges, and we just, again, want to try and be as clear as we can.\nWe are not surprised. I mean, when I say not surprised, we don't like the charge for sure. But it is just the reality of the position that we're in to get these things behind us and try to be clear in the remarks that this isn't the end of it. But we would like to move as quickly as we can on everything that's remaining to get behind us.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And one thing overall. And I think even with these costs and the charges, we're continuing to make sure that we invest in the underlying businesses, too. I think Charlie highlighted a little bit of that in his remarks, but we've got to keep making sure that we're adding people where we need to, we're building out the capabilities where we need to.\nAnd we've talked some -- about some of those opportunities in the past, but we are also doing that as well as executing on the efficiency agenda to make sure the earnings capacity of the company continues to get better.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nIt helps. OK. Perfect. Thank you, guys, very much.\nI appreciate it.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, Charlie and Mike. Charlie, I want to ask you a follow-up on your comments about protecting your capital in an uncertain environment. Going back to the CCAR, when you correctly stated you've got a lot of excess room, a lot of flexibility.\nJust wondering how you expect that CET1 to traject relative to where you want to keep it? And what does that mean in this environment for the prospects of doing share repurchase? Or do you just -- is it a build in, just keep it and be protected environment? Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nMaybe I'll start, Ken, and then Charlie can add anything. I think our thinking hasn't changed much since last quarter. We don't feel like we need to build from here. As you know, we've got about 110 basis points of cushion over our reg minimum and buffers together.\nAnd I think as you sort of look at the environment we're in, we just -- we want to be -- continue to be prudent about how and when do we do buybacks. I think even if you think about the third quarter and look at the rate volatility we saw in the last three weeks of the quarter, and even in the last number of days of the fourth quarter now in the beginning, we've seen quite a bit of volatility happening. And so it's just all of those things that go into the calculus we do every quarter to look at where the risks and opportunities are, and make sure that we're just being smart about managing it.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd the only thing I would add is I think, as Mike said, we feel very good about the growing earnings capacity of the company. And certainly, as we sit and look forward based upon what we actually see, we feel very good about the position that we're in. We just also -- and in the most comments, trying to point out that when it comes to managing capital, we should be extremely conscious of what the risks are that are around us. There are swings in AOCI that have impacted many of us.\nThere are these geopolitical risks out there which something could trigger something, which could ultimately have a broader impact on the economy. And those are all reasons just, given where we sit today, to be more conservative on capital rather than less conservative. And so a combination of those things with our own issues just lead us to say let's just see how those things play out. And that, for this environment that we're in, is probably the best use of that capital.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGot it. And a follow-up just in terms of other uses of that capital, just in question. You did build the reserve a little bit this quarter and alluded to the potential for a greater uncertainty. Just -- can you help us understand just where you live now in a scenario weightings in terms of your reserve? And Charlie, your point in your prepared remarks is just things might turn, but it's just unclear to say how.\nSo how do you contemplate, how do we get a better sense of what that might mean for reserves, and how your view on potential losses has changed?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThat's a hard one to answer. So when we set our -- when we go through the process of set reserves, I think we do what everyone else does with the CECL calculations, which is we have a series of scenarios that we look at that are economically driven based upon economists' view of what will happen to a series of variables that will impact our credit. We then go through and figure out what we think the right weighting is for those, depending on as we sit here in the environment, and then models produce a bunch of results. So there just -- there is so many factors that go into it.\nThere is a lot of signs behind it, but there is also a judgment that sits on top of it relative to how you weigh these things and whether the models are ultimately right. We think that, on a relative basis, just the way we think about things, to the extent you can build, you can be conservative, you're trying to be. But it's got to be fairly formulaically driven. And I would say as we sit here today, we're not assuming -- let me say differently.\nI think the comments that we're making about the risks in the environment factor into how we weight the different scenarios and so we do have weightings to the different downside scenarios. And I think that's --\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And maybe I'll just add, we've said this now for the last couple of quarters, we've had a pretty significant weighting on the downside scenarios for a while and haven't changed that. I think you -- if you look at what we've built over the -- during COVID, I guess, a couple of years ago now. Relative to where we are today, we haven't released all of that build that happened.\nAnd so all of what Charlie talked about goes into the conversation. And so at this point, we still feel very comfortable with where we are.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nUnderstood. OK. Thanks, guys.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. The only thing I want to just be clear about that is, again, we try and be -- and you have to be forward-looking, and so we're trying to be very realistic about what potential outcomes are. But at the same time, if our view deteriorates on the level of risk out there, that could change. And so getting back to the capital comment, I do think it's kind of weird that this all runs through the income statement.\nAnd for that level, it's hard to predict. From our perspective, we do have to -- the way we think about reserving and the way we think about capital are very much the same.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks again.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHey. Good morning. I guess just a quick follow-up around credit. I think from a fundamental standpoint, one, are there any areas in particular? I think you've talked about seeing some weakness in Auto lending in the past.\nAre there any areas within the portfolio, seeing any signs of crack on credit or where you're being a little bit more careful in extending new lending? And also, if Charlie or Mike, if you can talk about just your exposure within the C&I book to the financial sponsors, how -- your comfort level around that book, and whether any of that comes back to kind of create some credit volatility over the coming quarters? Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. Maybe I'll think I'll start on the last piece. I think you're referring to leverage finance bridge, the bridge book? It's very immaterial in terms of any impact this quarter, so nothing -- no story there in terms of anything significant in the quarter. As it relates a little bit more broadly on credit, for the most part, the portfolios are performing really well, right? And if you go look in the commercial bank, customers are still in really good shape on average, same thing in the corporate investment bank.\nOn the consumer side, Charlie pointed out a lot of health indicators still look really good. We're not seeing systematic stress. You're certainly seeing a little bit more stress on the lower end, wealth spectrum, which is in a big part of the portfolio for us. And so overall, so far, so good in terms of the performance to date.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI would say, Ebrahim, that we're -- we spend a lot of time on the wholesale side looking at inflation-sensitive industries. As I mentioned in my remarks and just try and get ahead where we can, we don't see problems, but we're just trying to be very forward-looking. And on the consumer side, we're just -- we're digging. We're digging through all of the information that we have to look for signs of stress.\nI think if you were to change the scale and like low the scales up significantly, you start to see very, very small impact on some payment rates. But we saw impacts to the lower-end consumers several quarters ago, and those haven't progressed as quickly as we would have thought. So again, it's just -- we don't have our heads in the sand. We sit here and we have listened to the Fed and take them at their word, and what they are doing is extremely powerful.\nAnd so things will slow, but we are just -- we are trying to be prudent. And the only -- and the last thing I would just say is some of our products, I would say, we are tightening up on the edges. Again, just to be prudent, some of the higher risk categories that have multiple risk layers to them. Not a big part of our production in any of our products, but just trying to be smart relative to who could be impacted.\nBut at the same time, continuing to be in the markets and providing credit.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. And just a quick follow-up, Mike, what I was referring to on the C&I book is the disclosures around exposure to financials, except ex-banks. And so when I am thinking about like asset management, real estate finance, anything there that we should worry about in a world where there is some uncertainty around how private equity holds up in this environment of higher rates? That's what I was sort of getting at.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSorry. Yes. So we -- if you look at the Q, there is some breakdown of those exposures, and you can see that. And those -- at this point, those are all performing really well, both in the asset-backed finance space as well as the subscription finance space.\nAnd so nothing to call out.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. On -- I know you mentioned that you still see substantial opportunity on the efficiency side for improvement. And on that end, can you talk about the gross cost saves? I know you have increased the target from $8 billion to $10 billion this year, early this year in January. Can you talk about the potential that could that number move higher yet again as your -- as you look at all the opportunities in front of you?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. John, look, I am sure we will provide more guidance on that or more disclosure on that in January, so I will leave any specific remarks there. But I would just go back to like what we have been saying, we are not done on the efficiency journey. As we execute on the stuff that's in front of us, we continue to find more opportunity really across most parts of the company, and so I think that will continue to evolve.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK, Mike. Thanks. And then in terms of the mortgage expectation, I think you indicated that you could see some incremental downside pressure there. Can you maybe help us size up the magnitude that you could see in the fourth quarter in terms of an incremental decline?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Well, I mean if you look at the -- in the consumer banking and lending segment, we have got the mortgage banking income there. It's only a little over a $200 million for the quarter. So even a relatively substantial percentage decline is a pretty small dollar decline these days given the run rate.\nBut I think if you look at what happened this quarter, we probably came in a little bit better than what we guided in July. Spreads were a little bit better in August than what we had forecasted, but they came back down in September, and so we would expect that to continue. So while I think there could be some downside there, it's off a pretty low run rate at this point.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. And then just one more follow-up on the balance sheet, and I am sorry if you had pointed to this already. But in terms of the pressure on the positive balances, can you talk about maybe how we should think about potential incremental declines in deposits as we see the impacts of the rate hikes continue to take hold?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think one, I think you are going to continue to see pricing increase from here, as we have said now for a while. And so you will see pricing go up as rates continue to increase. And then on the deposit side, all of it is somewhat natural, right, given the environment we are in. So as I pointed out in my remarks in the -- we saw the biggest dollar decline in our wealth business, which is clients moving to higher-yielding cash alternatives.\nNow, we are also seeing more broadly, clients move into cash there in a couple of areas where we have seen cash alternatives grow substantially, not just as they migrate away from deposits. So that's a piece of it. And then I think on the rest of the book, it's -- what we are seeing on the consumer side is a lot of spending. Not as much people much -- migrating away from us, or maybe there is a little bit of that, but it's really people out there spending.\nAnd then on the corporate investment bank, which are going to be some of your most rate-sensitive deposits, we are seeing the activity we expected to see, which is there are some clients moving into the other alternatives, but we still see many clients staying in cash with us as well. So I would expect that there is going to be -- there could be some further declines as we go.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. Thanks, Mike. Appreciate the color.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open, miss.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Just another question on expenses, if I may. I guess the market -- what the market is telling us today is that so long as the core expenses are as expected, the market seems to be looking through higher op losses.\nAnd as we look forward, Charlie and Mike, as you think about the budgeting process for next year, I think the Street expects operating losses to be improving to be a strong contributor to expense improvements going forward, even off of that original $1.3 billion expectation. I am just wondering, as you think about the budgeting, do you continue to contemplate adjustments on the core? Meaning, cutting core --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nOperating losses or expenses, excluding operating losses, Erika?\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nI meant expenses, excluding operating losses. I think your investors are expecting op losses to be down meaningfully even from that $1.3 billion original number. I am wondering if you are continuing to contemplate on the core?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, let me take a shot at it. I would say, again, first of all, I just want to remind you that we said in the prepared comments that we just want to be as transparent as we can, that we would -- that it's quite possible. And we said, I think likely, highly likely that we will have more significant -- potentially significant losses related to some of these historical matters. So we just want that to be on the radar screen.\nNo question, excluding that, our ops losses are still high, what I would just encourage people to think about is I personally wouldn't model them coming down until we actually see them coming down. Because again, as we go through and build the control environment, we are going to find things and we need to get that behind us. And I think that should be very much of a show me proposition, because again, we know what you know and we will see it when it happens. And we have done a little bit of advanced notice because we see all the work that we are doing, but we need to work through those things.\nAnd on the rest of op expenses, as we said, we are going to provide more specific guidance for that in the fourth quarter relative to next year, and also talk about how it plays into 15% sustainable ROTCE. And our budget, I also want to make the point because I think this is important to everyone. On the one hand, everyone wants -- we all want our expenses to go down because of what it does to earnings. But we are extremely -- I mean, even when we live in these two worlds, which is where we are rectifying these issues from the past, which are both building the risk and control work that's necessary and all the regulatory work and fixing the expense structure.\nBut we also very much have no intention of falling behind in our businesses. And so the two paths of conversations that we have through the budget process is what are we investing in and where are we going to see efficiencies. And we obviously have to make sure that we are getting the appropriate amount from each of those categories. Overall, there is no question that our efficiency ratios are not where they want them to be.\nSo directionally, that just tells you how we are thinking about how -- where that goes. But when we finish the process, we will provide more clarity, but just know that we are thinking about both sides of that equation. But understand what -- where we should be more long-term.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nNo. I think that makes sense. And I think the conversation with investors, Charlie, is sort of the next step for Wells Fargo in terms of accelerated investment spend, right? Efficiencies, obviously, a ratio, so that makes sense. And my follow-up question maybe is for you, Mike.\nSo I am squeezing two parts to my second question. The first is, could you tell us what unemployment ratio, your ACL ratio today contemplates? And second, if you could just give a comment on where you see deposit betas trending relative to your previous expectation now that we have added 100 basis points onto the expectation for Fed funds since we have talked to you last in the quarterly earnings setting?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Well, let me take the first one first. So if you look at our Q, we do give you a kind of weighted blend of the economic scenarios and we give you a few data points, unemployment rate is one of them. As of the end of June, the weighted -- actually, not the right one.\nThe rated number for the end of this year was 4.1%, growing to 6% at the end of 2023. And we will update that based on the third quarter and the Q when we get there. On the second part of the question, what was the second -- can you just repeat the second part? I am sorry about that.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nDeposit betas, has your thinking on cumulative deposit betas changed as we contemplated 2023, given that we added 100 basis points of the Fed's funds outlook since we spoke to you last in this quarterly earnings setting?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think so far, the betas have played out the way we expected them to do at this point in the cycle. And I think as rates continue to go up, we would expect them to increase, and that was part of the playbook and the analysis we had done going into the environment. And so -- and that's to be expected, right. And the if rates are going to go up even higher than we originally thought, then the betas will continue to go up with that.\nAnd so I think it's largely at this point playing out the way we thought it would.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nMatt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. Can you give us an update on your rate positioning, and thoughts on whether you want to lock it in the kind of rate level that we are at here, what's expected, or how you are thinking about protecting yourselves from potentially lower rates, or what your perspective is on that? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I mean we still have -- we are still asset sensitive as where we stand today, and so that will -- we will continue to get the benefit as rates go up. But as you suggest, I think most banks are thinking about not just about today, but also about the other side of when rates start to peak and come back down. And I think the expectations around them have changed quite substantially.\nCertainly since the second quarter, but even throughout the third quarter into where we stand today, those expectations have changed a lot. So I would say at this point, we are spending a lot of time thinking about that question and how we want to protect part of the balance sheet from when rates would start to decline. But we haven't done anything in a material way at this point.\nMatt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nGood morning.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nTwo questions. One, on loans, how should we think about how much more room there is for you to grow loans within the context of the asset cap, realizing that there is a constraint so you can't get to maybe the level as a percentage of total assets or total earning assets that you could before GFC? I know it's a long time ago, but I am just trying to understand what running room you think you have in the loan book to grow that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Betsy, I think as we have said I think even last quarter, we have got room to continue to grow and be there for clients. And we have got levers to pull if and when we think we need to create more capacity to do that. And so at this point, we are comfortable that we are going to be able to continue to be there for clients.\nAnd there is always discretionary stuff that you can do in certain pockets of your loan portfolio, and so I think we have got -- we feel comfortable at this point that we can still be there.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. And then separately on the AOCI pull to part, can you give us a sense as to what we should put in the model for how long that should take?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nHow long -- what part of that should take?\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThe underwater AFS book, right? Like if rates were flat with quarter end 3Q, you have got --\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWhen do you start to accrete back the AOCI?\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYeah. Yeah. How long does it take to accrete back the AOCI?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nIt takes a while. So you guys -- I think we have mentioned -- this just came up last quarter and the expectations really haven't sort of changed much, and it will take a while to come back. It will come slowly back year by year as the maturity of the bonds get shorter.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. All right. No. I was just wondering because we have seen some portfolio restructurings at other places and didn't know if you had put hedges on that would have changed the pace, because obviously, it's meaningful to the capital outlook.\nSo I am just wondering if there is any color there, but I guess not. All right. Thanks.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. Your line is open.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nI wanted to follow up on the deposit beta question. As I am sure you are aware, Treasury is talking to the TBAC committee and trying to get some advice on a treasury buyback. I was curious what your thoughts are about how that would affect liquidity flows, potentially out of money market funds into the banking system, and therefore, how that might affect your deposit beta assumptions next year?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nI think cause an effect and how that will play into deposit betas would be a really hard question to answer. I mean that will -- if that comes to bear, that will be one of like many different factors that will go into what to expect from deposit levels, and therefore, betas over time. So I wouldn't attempt to try to put some math behind that at this point.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nBut at the very least, would you view it as a net positive or in isolation, or is it a non-event in isolation?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nI mean it really depends on what it is and how big in size, and so I think it could be that full range. It could be a non-event or matter. But I think until you have better clarity, it's hard to say.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nAnd assuming it's a $1 trillion type of treasury buyback, which I think is the capacity they have?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I think it's just a really hard question to try to put math behind at this point.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of J.P Morgan. Your line is open, sir.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nThanks. Charlie, Mike -- Charlie, I wanted to just follow-up on your comment earlier about you are seeing declines in deposits before -- below pre-pandemic levels in certain cohorts. Can you talk a little bit about that? What level of balances kind of cohorts are you talking about, and how much have they gone down below pre-pandemic levels?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I will turn it over to Mike. But I just -- this is the same thing that we had talked about in the prior quarter whereas those that entered the pandemic with the lowest of balances to begin with, where they had balances for a period of time that remains above pre-pandemic levels, and we started to see declines ultimately in spend and deposit levels for that group now that are averaging below pre-pandemic levels. But as I said in the prepared remarks, we would have expected that.\nI would have expected that to exacerbate and spread, and it hasn't really. It's still a small part of our customer base.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And in fact, these are customers generally that have $500 or $1,000, or $2,000 kind of average balances per month, and there is a percentage of those customers that have seen some declines. And there is also a percentage -- some of those customers that haven't, right. So it is just one of the different cohorts we have looked at.\nBut as Charlie said, that hasn't really started to go up in higher wealth cohorts or income cohorts.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nOK. And it sounded like from your comments that start -- that decline has happened this quarter. So I guess for the group that we are seeing, it probably gets worse as inflation remains high?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo. This is a continuation of a trend we saw in second quarter as well. So it's not necessarily accelerating in any way, but it's a continuation of a trend we have seen now for a number of months.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nMike, a little one for you. Card delinquencies, you gave 30 plus. Can you break that down to 30 days to 89 days of the early delinquencies, what those did this quarter?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThere will be more in the Q, I think we are back on that.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nOK. You don't -- OK. The suggestion to just have it out at earnings because, obviously, given that we are starting to change environment, it's an important metric to keep an eye on. Thanks.\nOperator\nThe final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Sir, your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, Mike. Good morning, Charlie. Mike, can you share with us the trends you are seeing in the commercial real estate area? You guys had very strong revenue growth, of course, in commercial real estate this quarter year over year.\nThe commercial real estate mortgage balances were slightly down. But we are hearing from different folks that the commercial real estate market starting to tighten up, banks aren't as being as aggressive in lending. Can you -- any color on the risk dynamics that you might be seeing and the trends you are seeing in commercial real estate mortgage?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. Let me start with just what's driving some of the growth you have seen, right. So loan balances are up year to date and year over year. Really driven by two things, growth in multifamily, apartments, and some growth in some industrial properties.\nAnd so we still see really strong demand. I think even if you look at new housing, new multifamily housing starts, still growing. Hasn't really turned like single-family homes has over the last number of months, still -- so really strong demand there. I think when you look at the performance of the portfolio, some of the categories that were most impacted by the pandemic hotels, retail.\nIn most cases, are back. Good cash flow, values are fine, and we are seeing that hold up pretty well. You still have some forward-looking uncertainty in the office space, just given that hasn't really translated into significant stress yet because you still have long-term leases and other things. You always hear about an anecdotal issue of the property, but it has -- nothing systematic yet rolling through the portfolio.\nI can't speak about what others are doing. But I think for us, you have seen good growth this year. And as you go into an uncertain environment, you are just -- you are going to try to be smart about what you put on -- new things you put on your balance sheet, and we continue to do that. But that's in the context of seeing some good growth year to date.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. Obviously, your guys' CET1 ratio is well above your required level, and I think you pointed out your AOCI mark drew it down by about 21 basis points. Would you guys consider repositioning the available-for-sale portfolio since you are already taking the mark through your CET1 ratio? What kind of dynamics would you need to see if that would make sense for you to do that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYou always look at -- you have different ways to optimize. We did -- we did do a little bit in the second quarter where we traded out some mortgage -- blanking on the name, but some mortgage-backed securities for Ginnie Mae, you get a little better RWA treatment. So you do -- we have done some little bit of repositioning over the time. And it's something we always sort of look at and think at.\nBut it's not something that we are contemplating in big size at this point.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAll right. Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAll right. Thank you very much, everyone. We look forward to talking to you next quarter.

I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss fourth-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie. \nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks very much, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our 2021 results, the operating environment and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth quarter results and some of our expectations for 2022 before we take your questions. Let me start with some 2021 highlights.\nWe earned $21.5 billion or $4.95 per common share in 2021. Expenses declined 7% from a year ago, reflecting lower operating losses and progress on our efficiency initiatives. Revenue increased 6% as we benefited from strong gains from equity securities and gain from sales of our student lending, asset management and corporate trust businesses. We also have broad-based revenue growth across our businesses, including home lending, consumer and small business banking, credit card, auto, commercial real estate, banking and wealth and investment management.\nCredit quality improved significantly as the economy improved and our customers had high levels of liquidity. Our loan charge-off ratio declined from 35 basis points in 2020 to 18 basis points in 2021, and our allowance for credit losses declined by $5.7 billion. Deposits increased $78 billion or 6% and loans grew 1%, with declines in the first half of the year offset by a 5% increase in the second half. We also returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share in the third quarter.\nAnd we repurchased $14.5 billion of common stock, predominantly in the second half of the year after the return to the SCB framework. Our results in the fourth quarter also showed continued broad-based momentum. We earned $5.8 billion or $1.38 per common share. We grew loans by $32.6 billion or 4% and deposits by $12.1 billion or 1% from the third quarter.\nExpenses declined 1% from the third quarter and 11% from a year ago, and we generated positive operating leverage over both periods. Most importantly, we continued to prioritize our risk and control work. And the strong economy continues to positively impact our customers and our results. Consumers continue to have more liquidity than prior to the pandemic, though we do see this declining as the median balances today are 27% higher than pre-pandemic levels but are down 10% from the third quarter.\nConsumer credit card spend also continued to be strong, up 28% from the fourth quarter of 2020 and up 27% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Holiday sales were strong with spending up 31% the three weeks leading up to Thanksgiving and that momentum continued post Thanksgiving. All spending categories were up in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, with the largest increases in travel, fuel, entertainment and dining. Weekly debit card spend during the fourth quarter was up every week compared to both 2019 and 2020.\nThis increase was driven by higher transactions but also higher spend per transaction, reflecting inflationary impacts and increased spending in higher cost categories such as travel. We are watching the impact from Omicron on consumer spending. And while there is some softening in restaurant, travel and entertainment in recent weeks, overall spending remained strong in the first week of January with credit card up 26% and debit card up 29% versus the same week in 2020. And we saw strong loan growth from the third quarter across our commercial businesses, including commercial real estate, asset-based lending, middle market banking and our markets and banking businesses.\nSo I've been at the company for a little over two years now, and I thought I'd spend a few minutes giving you my thoughts on our progress. Overall, I feel great about what we've accomplished and continue to feel energized about the opportunities in front of us. I think about this along several dimensions: talent, leadership and culture, risk regulatory and control, financial and strategic progress and our work on ESG and broader reputational issues. I've spoken of the substantial talent changes we've made, but just to remind you, 11 of 18 members are new to the operating committee and two are new to their job since I arrived.\nAdditionally, well over half of the senior-most people at our company, meaning those who are one level below the operating committee, are new to their roles and a significant proportion of them were hired from outside the company. This is a dramatic change in our leadership. And with it, we've changed how we run the company, how we prioritize our work and how we view our responsibility broadly. We began a process two years ago to change the culture and priorities of the company.\nAnd the most significant part of this prioritization was the building and implementation of an effective risk and control framework across the company. Our approach and our progress are entirely different than they were when I arrived. We are laser-focused on meeting our own expectations and those of our regulators. We have clear plans in place and clear owners for every regulatory deliverable we have.\nWe have detailed reporting on how we're progressing on those plans. We review this reporting every single week at the operating committee level. The detailed involvement of the operating committee members is very different from what was happening before I arrived. Our ability to identify issues has also improved from two years ago.\nI continue to believe that we're making significant progress, and this is based on what we see in our internal reporting. It doesn't mean that we're perfect. The fact that we have multiple consent orders makes it complex. It takes time to build all of our capabilities.\nAnd it's certainly in the regulator's purview to look at issues that have been outstanding for a long time, like the OCC did in the third quarter. But I would point you to the comment made by the OCC in their recent consent order that highlights that we have taken steps to comply with their 2018 order, and we're committed to addressing remaining requirements. I remain confident in our ability to continue to close the remaining gaps over the next several years. Having said that, it continues to be the case that we're likely to have setbacks along the way, but that doesn't change the fact that we believe that the quality of the talent we now have and the processes we now have in place will enable us to get the work done.\nWe're making progress increasing the earnings power of the company and have also begun to invest in a more holistic and aggressive way to drive stronger organic growth in all of our businesses. We're just now beginning to bring things to market that are differentiated and the number of significant opportunities are exciting. We're continuing to track to the financial return goals we've discussed: first, achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past and then target 15%. We continue to believe that we will achieve the 10% during one of the quarters in 2022 on an annualized basis.\nTo achieve this, we're aggressively focused on driving efficiencies and we're seeing net expense reductions after significant investments in our control build-out and our businesses. We are aggressively returning excess capital to shareholders now that we've returned to the SCB framework. We continue to manage credit well, and we're seeing early benefits from higher interest rates, growing loan balances and higher fees in certain businesses. We're doing this while devoting significant resources to building our franchise.\nWe have fallen behind in providing competitive digital capabilities for our clients. This is changing. In the fourth quarter, we announced a rebuilt mobile banking experience for consumer and small business customers that is set to begin rolling out this quarter. It has a new modern look and feel and a simpler user experience that will help our customers more easily accomplish their banking needs.\nThis platform is necessary to drive significantly higher digital adoption from our customers. Even with our existing capabilities, in the fourth quarter, our customers logged in 1.6 billion times using a mobile device, up 7% year over year. Teller transactions remained more than 30% lower than pre-pandemic levels. We also announced that later this year, we'll be adding an all-new virtual assistant, Fargo to the app.\nCustomers will be able to get answers to their everyday banking questions, ask Fargo to complete the task for them, and Fargo will also provide personalized insights and recommendations to help customers better manage their finances. We will also be introducing the first phase of the redesign of our public website early this year. In addition, we're beginning to become more active on the wholesale side. For example, we announced that we're collaborating with HSBC to optimize the settlement of foreign exchange transactions through a blockchain-based solution, which will reduce settlement risks and associated costs.\nWe're also approaching payments and credit cards very differently. We believe credit cards will remain important as both the credit and as a payment vehicle. We were also doing additional work around non-card payments and believe we must succeed here to be a key financial services provider. Two years ago, our products and capabilities supporting those products were not as competitive as necessary.\nIn 2021, we launched two products including, Active Cash, which we believe is the best cash-backed product in the marketplace, and Reflect, which rewards customers for on-time payments. We improved the core experience, including investing in advertising, simplifying our digital application and enhancing our underwriting. These efforts have driven an increase in digital card activation, paperless statements and enrollment alerts. We are opening approximately twice as many accounts as we were prelaunch of these products, and importantly, we're not competing on credit.\nIn fact, the quality of applications and the accounts for booking continues to be better than what we were booking historically. Away from card, we're beginning to invest in our broader digital payments across the platform, enhancing our capabilities, increasing limits and broadly reducing the friction and moving money. As evidence, Zelle momentum continued to accelerate with Zelle transactions up 46% from a year ago. We are also taking a very different approach in that we believe that for us to be successful.\nWe must consider a broader set of stakeholders in our decisions and actions. This is not in lieu of shareholders. In fact, we believe it will enhance our returns to shareholders over time. We have taken significant efforts to support small businesses since the beginning of the pandemic and recently fulfilled our roughly $420 million Open for Business fund commitment to assist small businesses in recovering from the pandemic, by working with not-for-profits to offer capital, technical assistance and long-term programs.\nThe fund was created by donating the gross processing fees we made from administering the Paycheck Protection Program loans in 2020. Additionally, we made significant climate commitments in 2021. In the fourth quarter, we joined the Net Zero Banking Alliance, an industry-led leadership group designed to foster collaboration and support banks in aligning their financing with the goal of achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change is one of the most urgent environmental and social issues of our time.\nAnd last year, we announced our goal to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, including emissions attributable to financing by 2050. We expect to announce our first finance emission targets for the oil and gas and power sectors later this year. We made our first solar-plus-battery-storage tax equity commitment. Once it is operational, it will be one of the largest solar and battery projects in the company.\nLast year, we surpassed $13.3 billion in cumulative tax equity investments in nearly 600 wind, solar and fuel cell transactions. These investments have provided 13% of all utility scale wind and solar capacity in the U.S. over the past 16 years. We continue to be one of the top investors in affordable multifamily housing in the U.S.\nas well as an active lender for affordable rental housing developments. Additionally, we're committed to expanding affordable homeownership. For example, in the fourth quarter, we committed to invest $5 million through the Neighborhood LIFT program to help more than 300 low and moderate income residents in Houston with home payment down assistance -- I'm sorry, home down payment assistance. We've also supported our employees and in December, we announced that as part of our commitment to providing comprehensive benefits and competitive pay, we're increasing U.S.\nminimum pay hourly pay levels to a range of $18 to $22 effective at the end of this month. Just this week, we announced new efforts that will roll out over the course of 2022 to help our consumer customers avoid overdraft fees and cover short-term cash needs, building on other changes we've made over the last several years. The changes we announced include the elimination of transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection, the elimination of nonsufficient fund fees, early access to direct deposit by providing customer access to funds up to two days before their scheduled deposit, a 24-hour grace period for customers that overdraw their account to cover the balance before incurring an overdraft fee, and a new short-term credit product for customers to meet personal financial needs. This builds on existing features we already have in place, including Clear Access Banking, our no-overdraft checking account that we launched in September 2020, and we now have over 1.1 million outstanding customer accounts.\nOverdraft Rewind, which was introduced in 2017, which automatically rewinds overdraft fees when a covering direct deposit is received by the next morning, which were replaced by our expanded 24-hour grace period. Balance alerts that help customers avoid overdraft by sending more than 1.3 million alerts every day. Putting all of these changes in perspective, these fees are down significantly since the financial crisis. We have alternatives for both customers that do not want to overdraft and those that do.\nThis is a competitive marketplace. We continue to review our capabilities and pricing with the goal of providing value to our customer. And let me make a few comments now as we look forward. While there is a risk with the continued growth of the Omicron variant or potentially other variants later this year, I expect to see continued strong economic trends in 2022.\nConsumers' financial condition remains strong. Modest debt growth, strong asset appreciation and higher deposit balances have left household balance sheets in excellent condition, which should help drive continued strong consumer spending. Corporate America has demonstrated the ability to adapt to the ever-changing pandemic conditions. Inventories remained unusually lean as businesses adopted a defensive posture and supply chains have been disrupted.\nThis is expected to result in substantial gains in industrial production as they continue to restock. We're beginning to see loan growth and expect this to continue. In a moment, Mike will provide our thoughts on net interest income and expenses for 2022. I commented earlier that we remain on target to achieve a sustainable 10% ROTCE, subject to the same assumptions we've discussed in the past, on a run rate basis at some point this year.\nAnd that once we've achieved this goal, we'll discuss our plan to continue to increase returns. But at a high level, we continue to believe we can further improve our returns through a combination of factors including a modest increase in interest rates or further steepening of the curve; ongoing progress on incremental efficiency initiatives; a small impact from returns on growth-related investments in our businesses; continued execution on our risk and regulatory control framework; and moderate balance sheet growth once the asset cap is lifted. It's important to note we currently have the ability to grow loans even under the asset cap. The changes we made to the company and continued strong economic growth prospects make us feel good about how we're positioned entering 2022.\nWe also remain cognizant that we still have a multiyear effort to satisfy our regulatory requirements with setbacks likely to continue along the way. And we continue our work to put exposures related to our historical practices behind us. As we look forward, we will continue to be aggressive in driving progress and improvement in our performance, embrace our responsibility to our customers and communities, and I remain incredibly optimistic about our future. I want to conclude by thanking our employees who continue to serve our customers through another challenging year.\nI appreciate their hard work and their resiliency while we made progress on making Wells Fargo better. I look forward to all that we accomplish in the year ahead. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nGreat. Thanks, Charlie, and good morning, everybody. Charlie summarized how we helped our customers, communities and employees last year on Slides 2 and 3, so I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.38 common share.\nOur fourth-quarter results included a $943 million net gain on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. There could be future gains related to these sales due to post-closing adjustments and earn-out provisions; an $875 million decrease in allowance for credit losses as credit trends continue to be strong; and a $260 million impairment of certain leased railcars due to changes in demand for these cars. We also had $2.5 billion or $1.9 billion after non-controlling interest of equity gains, primarily from our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, the third consecutive quarter of strong returns in these businesses. Our effective income tax rate in the fourth quarter was approximately 23%, including the discrete impacts related to business divestitures.\nOur CET1 ratio declined to 11.4% in the fourth quarter, reflecting share repurchases and an increase in risk-weighted assets primarily from loan growth in the quarter. We repurchased $7 billion of common stock in the fourth quarter, partially offset by $1.4 billion of new issuances, predominantly for the annual matching contribution for our 401k plans. As a reminder, the regulatory minimum for our CET1 ratio will be 9.1% in the first quarter of 2022, reflecting a lower G-SIB capital surcharge. Turning to credit quality on Slide 6.\nOur net charge-off ratio was 19 basis points in the fourth quarter. Commercial credit performance continued to be strong with net loan charge-offs declining $10 million from the third quarter to two basis points. Despite the challenges created by the pandemic, the commercial real estate portfolio has continued to perform well. Commercial real estate valuations and investment activity has rebounded off their lows across all property types, although there is still some risk in office and select hotel and retail segments.\nConsumer credit performance also remained strong with higher collateral values for homes and autos and consumer cash reserves remain above pre-pandemic levels. Consumer net charge-offs of $393 million increased $172 million from the third quarter. $152 million of the increase is related to a change in practice to fully charge off certain delinquent legacy residential mortgage loans. Nonperforming assets increased $145 million or 2% from the third quarter, driven by an increase in residential mortgage nonaccruals, primarily resulting from certain customers exiting COVID-related accommodation programs.\nLoans that were modified in 2021 upon exiting forbearance are reported as nonaccrual until they perform for a period of time. Overall, early performance of loans that have exited forbearance have been aligned with our expectations. After increasing during the first four quarters of the pandemic, commercial nonperforming assets have declined for four consecutive quarters, and we're back to pre-pandemic levels in the fourth quarter. Our allowance level at the end of the fourth quarter reflected continued strong credit performance, the ongoing economic recovery and the uncertainties that still remain.\nIf the economic recovery continues, we would expect to have additional reserve releases. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 2% from the third quarter with growth in both our commercial and consumer portfolios. We had strong growth late in the quarter and period-end loans grew $32.6 billion or 4% from the third quarter with broad-based growth across most of our commercial and consumer portfolios.\nI'll highlight the specific growth geographies over when discussing business segment results. Average deposits increased $89.9 billion or 7% from a year ago with growth in our consumer businesses and commercial banking, partially offset by continued declines in corporate, investment banking and in corporate treasury, reflecting targeted actions to manage under the asset cap. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. A year ago, we provided our expectation for 2021 net interest income to be flat to down 4% from the originally reported annualized fourth quarter 2020 level, and we ended up being down 3% for the full year.\nFourth quarter net interest income was down $93 million or 1% from a year ago and grew $353 million or 4% from the third quarter. The increase in the third quarter was driven by higher loan balances, including higher interest income from loans purchased from securitization pools or EPBOs. We also benefited from higher trading assets and a favorable funding mix. In the fourth quarter, we had $318 million of interest income associated with EPBOs, and at year-end, we had a total of $17.3 billion of these loans, down from $34.8 highlighted last quarter, we expect these balances to decline substantially by the end of this year.\nWe also had $130 million of interest income in the fourth quarter from Paycheck Protection Program loans or PPP loans, and are outstanding decline to $2.4 billion at year-end. We've reflected the headwind from these portfolios running off in our 2022 net interest income waterfall that I will review later on the call. The net interest margin increased eight basis points from the third quarter three basis points of which was due to higher interest income from EPBOs. Now turning to Expenses on Slide 9.\nNoninterest expense declined 11% from a year ago. The decrease reflected progress we made on our efficiency initiatives, including reductions in personnel costs, consultant spend and occupancy expense. I will provide specific examples of the progress we made in our efficiency initiatives in 2021 later on the call before updating you on our expense expectations for 2022. We also had lower restructuring charges and operating losses in the fourth quarter compared with a year ago.\nFourth quarter expenses included one month or approximately $100 million of operating expenses from our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management prior to their sales on November 1. Now turning to our business segments starting with Consumer Banking lending on Slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 4% from a year ago, primarily due to higher deposit-related fees as fourth quarter 2020 included some COVID-related fee waivers. Fourth quarter 2021 also reflected an increase in consumer activity, including higher debit card transactions compared with a year ago and the benefit of strong deposit growth was largely offset by lower spreads.\nCharlie highlighted the enhancements and changes we're making to help our customers avoid overdraft fees. The impact from the fees that will be reduced, including the elimination of nonsufficient fund or NSF fees as well as overdraft protection transfer fees, is estimated to be approximately $700 million annually. Also, we expect that they may be partially offset by other fees due to higher levels of activity as well as the expiration of various fee-related waivers that were in place in 2021. In terms of new features to be rolled out in the latter part of the year, including a 24-hour grace period for overdrafts and a new short-term loan product, we will have to observe how customers respond.\nHome lending revenue declined 8% from a year ago, primarily due to lower mortgage banking income, driven by lower gain on sale margins and origination volumes. Even before the recent rate back up, we started to see a drop in application volume in December, and we expect originations to decline in 2022, which will put pressure on margins as the industry adapts to the lower volume. Credit card revenue was up 3% from a year ago, driven by higher point-of-sale volume, partially offset by higher rewards costs, including promotional offers on our new active Cash Card. Auto revenue increased 17% from a year ago and higher loan balances with the average balances up $6.8 billion.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Our mortgage originations declined 7% from the third quarter. We expect our first quarter originations to continue to decline due to lower refinance activity and the typical seasonal slowdown in the purchase market. We increased our nonconforming originations in the fourth quarter and have grown our nonconforming portfolio for seven consecutive months, reflecting the improvements in our capabilities, as well as the reintroduction of cash-out refinancing late in the first quarter of 2021.\nTurning to Auto. Limited vehicle inventories continued to constrain industry new car sales. However, we had our third consecutive quarter of record originations with volume up 77% from a year ago, with the majority of our originations coming from used cars. Originations also benefited from the enhancements we continue to make in our capabilities.\nImportantly, we are maintaining our underwriting standards and continue to be cautious about the increase in vehicle prices over the last year or so. Turning to debit card. Transactions were relatively stable from the third quarter and up 10% from a year ago with increases across nearly all categories. Credit card point of sale purchase volume continued to be strong, was up 28% from a year ago and 11% from the third quarter.\nWhile payment rates remain elevated, balances grew 5% from a year ago due to strong purchase volume and the launch of new products. New credit card accounts more than doubled from a year ago, driven by our new active cash card, and we're pleased by the quality of the accounts we've been attracting. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 12. Middle market banking revenue increased 2% from a year ago.\nResults included higher deposit balances and modestly higher investment banking fees, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 1% from a year ago, driven by higher net gains from equity securities and higher revenue from renewable energy investments, partially offset by lower loan balances. Noninterest expense declined 10% from a year ago, primarily driven by lower personnel and consulting expense due to the efficiency initiatives as well as lower lease expense. Loan balances started to increase late in the third quarter and now have grown for four consecutive months with growth accelerating in December.\nAs with other portfolios, we are adhering to the same credit risk appetite. Increases in the middle market banking were driven by growth from our larger clients, a modest uptick in revolver utilization and strong seasonal borrowing. Growth in asset-based lending and leasing was driven by new client wins as well as increased levels from higher prices and some increases in inventory levels. Turning to corporate investment banking on Slide 13.\nBanking revenue increased 17% from a year ago. Investment banking had a strong quarter, with higher debt origination and advisory fees. Banking results also benefited from higher loan estate revenue grew 8% from a year ago, driven by higher loan balances and capital markets results in stronger commercial real estate financing activity. Loan originations returned to pre-pandemic levels, and we had a healthy pipeline as we started the new year.\nMarkets revenue was relatively stable from a year ago. It was down 14% from the third quarter, primarily due to lower trading activity in spread products and equity derivatives. Average deposits in corporate and investment banking were down $23.7 billion from a year ago, driven by actions taken across all lines of business to manage under the asset cap. Average loans increased from both the third quarter and a year ago across all lines of business.\nOn a period-end basis, loans grew every month since June and growth accelerated in December. Wealth and investment management on Slide 14. The revenue grew 6% from a year ago as higher asset-based fees and market valuations more than offset a decline in net interest income due to lower interest rates. The 5% increase in expenses from a year ago was primarily driven by higher revenue-related compensation, which was more than offset by higher revenue.\nThis increase was partially offset by lower salaries expense, reflecting progress on efficiency initiatives. Client assets year ago, primarily driven by higher market valuations. Average deposits were up 7% from a year ago and average loans increased 5% from a year ago, driven by continued momentum in securities-based lending. Slide 15 highlights our corporate results.\nRevenue increased from a year ago, driven by strong results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses and gains on the sales of our Corporate Trust Services business and Wells Fargo Asset Management. These businesses contributed $1.6 billion of revenue in 2021, excluding net gains on sale and $1.5 billion of noninterest expense. We expect approximately $200 million of these expenses associated with remain in 2022, with offsetting revenue so its P&L neutral. We also expect approximately $300 million of corporate overhead expenses related to these businesses to remain in 2022, which we expect to manage down over time.\nTurning now to our expectations for 2022, starting with Net Interest Income on Slide 16. As the last couple of weeks have demonstrated, it's challenging this early in the year to predict the rate environment, loan demand and other variables that impact net interest income for the full year. But let me highlight the key drivers of our net interest income for 2022. We are assuming the asset capital remain in place throughout 2022, moving left to right on the waterfall.\nAs we have discussed previously, we have a headwind this year from the runoff of PPP and EPBO loans. However, our current outlook loans is for average balances to grow low to mid-single digits from the fourth quarter of 2021 to the fourth quarter of 2022, along with other balance sheet mix changes, this is expected to more than offset that headwind. This net result would increase net interest income approximately 3% in 2022 from the $35.8 billion we generated in 2021. Moving to rates and repricing.\nThe recent forward curve includes approximately 325 basis point rate hikes this year beginning in May. Assuming these were to play out, net interest income has the potential to grow up to an additional 5%, resulting in approximately 8% net interest income growth in 2022 versus 2021. That said, the implied forward curve has changed a lot over the last one and a half months, so it's very hard to forecast with any certainty. Another way to view our asset sensitivity is from the disclosure we provided in our third quarter 10-Q filing.\nIt showed that the estimated impact of an instantaneous 50 basis points increase in short-term rates would increase net interest income by approximately $2.7 billion over the next 12 months. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2022 will depend on a variety of factors, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, loan demand and cash redeployment. Now turning to expenses on Slide 17. We made progress last year on our efficiency initiatives and we continue to identify new opportunities.\nOur portfolio of initiatives that includes realized and identified potential gross saves has grown from approximately $8 billion to $10 billion, and we are continuing to work across the company. We expect to execute on our remaining identified initiatives over the next two to three years, and we'll continue to invest across our businesses. Importantly, similar to last year, we are excluding from our efficiency initiatives the resources needed to address our risk and control work, and we'll continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work. We've been reducing expenses across our businesses, but let me highlight a few examples of the progress we made last year.\nWe eliminated management layers and increased bank control with a 20% decrease in managers with low spending control. We completed approximately 270 branch consolidations in 2021, a continuation of the progress we've made the last few years with branches down 11% since 2019. We've also optimized branch our customers or how our customers are using our branches. Within our technology organization, we reduced non-engineering roles by approximately 40%, driven by accelerated adoption of the agile framework.\nAnd headcount across the company declined approximately 6% from a year ago, excluding divested businesses. In addition to reducing the number of branches, we also reduced our office real estate portfolio by approximately 7% and occupancy expense was down 9% compared with a year ago. This year, we expect to continue to realize savings from these initiatives, including an incremental 5% reduction in office real estate. Additionally, the investments we're making in technology should drive improvements in operations, consumer banking, consumer lending, commercial banking.\nImportantly, these efforts should not only reduce expenses but also improve the customer experience with enhanced fraud detection, more service self-service capabilities and faster underwriting decisions. Now turning to our 2022 Expense Outlook on Slide 18. Following the waterfall from left to right, we reported $53.8 billion of noninterest expense in 2021. This was largely in line with our most recent guidance, except for higher operating losses.\nWe had approximately $500 million of expenses in 2021 related to business exits and restructuring charges and the civil money penalty associated with the OCC enforcement action in September. We also had approximately $1 billion of expenses in 2021 from the Wells Fargo Asset Management and our Corporate Trust Services business, which were sold and that will not continue in 2022. So we believe a good starting point for the discussion of 2022 expenses is the $52.3 billion. We are assuming a modest increase in equity markets this year and expect revenue-related expenses to grow by approximately $300 million.\nThis includes expected increases in wealth and investment management and corporate investment banking, partially offset by expected declines in home lending, reflecting lower origination volumes. Higher revenue-related compensation is a good thing, and the associated revenue will more than offset any increase in expenses. We also expect approximately $500 million of wage and benefits-related inflationary increases in 2022 above and beyond the normal level of merit and pay increases, driven by higher personnel expenses, including the minimum wage increase that Charlie highlighted and other compensation changes. Through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize approximately $3.3 billion of gross expense reductions from 2022.\nThis reduction is expected to be partially offset by approximately $1.2 billion of incremental investments primarily related to higher personnel in expenses in commercial banking, corporate and investment banking and technology, as well as increased spending on risk management. We also expect approximately $500 million in increased spending in other areas, including higher FDIC insurance assessments, higher travel and entertainment expenses, which were significantly lower in 2021 due to the pandemic. Accordingly, our full year 2022 expenses are expected to be approximately $51.5 billion, a net reduction of approximately $800 million versus the $52.3 billion. Embedded in our assumptions are approximately $1.3 billion of operating losses for 2022, which is the amount we had in 2021, excluding the $250 million associated with the OCC enforcement action.\nWhile we've made significant progress on working through legacy issues, as we've previously disclosed, we still have outstanding litigation and regulatory issues, and related expenses could significantly exceed the levels we had in 2021. We made substantial progress last year in executing our efficiency initiatives, but we still have significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. We are focused on achieving net expense reductions while appropriately investing in our businesses. This remains a multiyear process, with the ultimate goal of achieving an efficiency ratio in line with our peers and based on our business mix.\nWe'll now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our first question of the day will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Sir, your line is open.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHi good morning. Mike, I was wondering if you could give us some sense of if the asset cap remains in place, how much capacity do you have to grow loans? Obviously, the H8 data is picking up. It feels like loan growth is getting better for the industry. I just want to make sure that you're invited to that party and you guys can grow loans while staying under the asset cap.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. John, thanks for the question. So just as you know, and I think it's implicit in what you asked, but the constraint for us on the asset cap is really on the deposit side. And so that's the part where we're actively taking action to make sure we've got the room we need particularly for our retail clients and we're continuing to do that.\nOn the loan side, we're not constrained on growth on the loan side so we still have plenty of room to continue to grow with our clients.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nAnd could you give us some sense, in your NII outlook, what kind of loan growth you're building in and also liquidity deployment assumptions? And how you're thinking about liquidity deployment, given where the curve is here?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. On Slide 16, we've assumed a kind of low to mid-single-digit growth when you compare fourth quarter '21 to fourth quarter '22. And so hopefully, we're optimistic that we'll be able to get there and maybe there's certainly some scenarios where it could grow faster than that, but that's the assumption that we use there. Embedded in that column, too on the chart in the loan growth and other balance sheet stuff is some modest redeployment into the securities portfolio, I'd say modest so kind of mid- to low single digit sort of increases in the securities portfolio as well.\nAnd so those are the assumptions embedded there. And I think as we look at where the curve is today, we're still being, overall, pretty prudent and patient, but we are in a very kind of small way, beginning to buy some securities in the portfolio.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. Thanks Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Sir, your line is open.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning guys. Mike, you had mentioned that where you did a little bit better last year, $4 billion of gross saves versus what you originally thought at $3.6 billion, and you just commented that you still have a good line of sight as far as efficiency initiatives. Can you help us understand, like $3.3 billion for this year, how you're feeling about that? But more importantly, that line of sight, how far out do you have that? And do you continue to see an ability to take out this type of cost as you go forward even past this year?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. No. And Ken, what we're really trying to do is make sure we embed this in the DNA of how we operate the place, and so that's ultimately what's going to be really important for us over the long run. And I think you're seeing that.\nThe portfolio grew from eight billion to 10 billion in terms of the initiatives that we've either executed on or in the process of executing. And so I think you're seeing sort of that progress and growth there. So you can sort of do the math of what we've accomplished so far, what we've identified for this year and what's left for next year. And I continue to believe that we've got more to do that we haven't sort of built into that portfolio yet.\nAnd so the team continues to work on that every day. As you look at our confidence level on the $3.3 billion that we put into the forecast, we feel good. We've got really good line of sight. And I think given what the team was able to do last year, we have confidence that we'll be able to execute on that.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nLet me just add to something that Mike said. I'm a firm believer on these efficiency initiatives, especially in a company like this. Even if you go back over a decade, one of the strengths of this company was never efficiency. It was far more on the revenue side.\nAnd so as we get the efficiencies that we're starting to see, it is like peeling the onion back, where then the next set of opportunities become even clearer. And so we're ginning up the same process that we did at the beginning of this venture where we came up with the back and say, OK, now what's next in a very methodical way across the company. So I feel really good about what's in our numbers for next year. And we're going to continue to pursue this.\nAnd I think it's, just as you've seen in our numbers, it gives us the ability to spend our investments and to become more efficient overall as a company. So I personally don't feel like we're close to done.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGot it. And if I could just ask the other side of that question too, which is that you're doing a little less investments versus what you did last year. How do you get comfortable that you're doing enough, especially what we're hearing from the industry pressures, not just inflation but just on the need to continue to, and you mentioned this, Charlie, about all the new things you're rolling out? But how do you land on that number? And how do you get the confidence that it's the right amount that you're reinvesting?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, it's a good question. I think we do I think what most good companies do, which is they sit around tables and they ask everyone to come back with what you want to spend money on and then figure out what you can actually do. I think we've accomplished a tremendous amount on the technology side since Saul Van Beurden, who runs technology for us, was brought in. And I think we're going to try and spend as much as we physically can get done.\nBut I think we're always asking the question of what's next. But I think the different position that we're in versus others is we're still in the ramping-up stage, which I also look at as opportunity because we have moved slower historically investing in some of these areas. And to the extent that we find more efficiency money, it gives us the opportunity to spend more broadly. But I do feel -- I think we as a company, we, as a management team, do feel good about what we're investing next year relative to where we stand as a company.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThanks.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. I had two questions. One was on the overdraft fees that you mentioned.\nI think you said that it was like a $700 million impact, but we look at the regulatory filings and the regulatory filings show a higher level of overdraft fee run rate like in the $1 billion kind of range. So I'm just trying to understand why would it be only $700 million?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, first of all, I mean, we're not eliminating overdraft fees. We're making a series of changes that we think makes sense for the consumer. We have an account that doesn't allow overdraft but we have an account that does allow overdraft. And so we think it's more consumer-friendly than it was in the past, but we do continue to believe that there are a substantial number of customers out there that want us to pay overdraft on their behalf after they've worked through a bunch of the buffers and benefits we're giving them, and they're willing to pay for that.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it, OK. So the NSF fees will be eliminated but you'll have a different product that comes in?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, no, NSF fees will be eliminated entirely. Our overdraft fee will stay, but we've added a series of things such as we'll give you availability on direct deposits two days in advance. We'll give you an additional 24 hours after you otherwise would have been charged for an overdraft to cure it. So our overdraft fees will go down, but we're still going to be providing the overdraft product and we'll still be charging for it.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. All right. So my bad because I thought overdraft and NSF were pretty similar, but that's not...\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, I think -- Betsy, think of the NSF fees as when you don't pay something into overdraft like a check and you return it, then historically, you would have charged a fee for that returned item. That's an NSF fee. The overdraft fees come into play when you actually pay something in overdraft.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes. Yes, I got it. OK. So I was using too much jargon and that's my bad.\nAll right. And then the second question is on the loan growth that you were talking about earlier in the prepared remarks and with John. LIBOR is no longer able to be used as a reference rate for C&I or CRE or any loan or any product rights starting Jan 1. How does that impact you? Could that be a benefit to your loan growth in C&I and CRE? And how are you thinking about shifting the reference rate that you're going to be using with your clients?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I mean, we've started that shift already as you would imagine, right? And we stopped offering new -- effectively stopped offering new LIBOR-based loan products in the -- at some point in the fourth quarter. We've probably done, in the wholesale side, maybe including WIM, so take out the consumer mortgage business, we've done something like 4,500 or just under that new facilities based on SOFR, with the large majority and obviously, there's different ways to calculate SOFR, the large majority of those are using sort of a daily simple rate. So if SOFR moves, obviously, that will adjust. And so I think we're seeing clients start to get used to it and start to use it.\nComplementing what we're doing on the wholesale side is we've got. We've stopped offering LIBOR-based ARMs last year. And so we've got, I don't know, tens of thousands -- a couple of tens of thousands at this point in terms of ARMs on the books using using SOFR there as well. And so I think it's starting to take hold.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYes, I was just thinking like the capital markets might not be deep enough yet to be competitive against SOFR or product at least for the first half of this year. So could that give you a little advantage here in originating?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nI don't see that having a huge impact on loan growth but maybe we'll be surprised a little bit, but I don't see that happening.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nAll right, because I didn't think the CLO bid was there yet for SOFR.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I guess I don't see that happening. I think there are starting to be some CLOs and SOFR, but like I don't see that happen being a big driver.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. thanks.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Mike, my first question is for you. Could you give us a sense of what deposit growth or runoff assumption you have in your 2022 NII simulation? And similarly, what kind of deposit repricing you presume?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. No, thanks, Erika. Look, as you can guess, like we're in a bit of a different spot than others, right, given our asset cap. And so, we're already constrained on deposits and so we're pushing away deposits every week now.\nAnd so, I don't expect this year to have much of a runoff in deposits. And if we start to see deposit levels going down, we'll stop pushing others off. And so I don't see that going to be a big driver for 2022. As you think about betas and deposit pricing assumptions, it's largely similar to what we saw the last rate cycle.\nBut I would say that over the last three, four, five years, our deposit base has changed quite a bit. If you look at just based on the segments we are in, as a shorthand, where 57% of our deposits are in our consumer and small business banking business today. If you go back a number of years, that was probably closer to 43% or 45%. And so the remixing of sort of our deposits as a result of some of the actions we've had to take will kind of lower the overall beta for the first number of rate hikes.\nBut I think it will look pretty similar to what we saw. And as you can imagine, since we're constrained on growing deposits, we're not going to be the leader on pricing likely as we go over the next number of quarters.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nAnd just to clarify, so the betas in the last cycle, if I remember, were driven by a handful of CIB deposits, right? Clearly, that has been pushed out, given assets. Some of that has been pushed out, given asset cap restrictions. So embedded in this NII number is the experience of the last cycle that included the betas contributed by those deposits, whereas as we actually look out today, you have a much better and less rate-sensitive deposit base.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nFor sure. And the betas might be similar on the CIB deposits. We just have less of them as a percentage of the overall book, which lowers our overall beta.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nJust the mix.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, but we'll see. And a lot of that will be driven by what we see in the competitive environment, right? So particularly on those wholesale deposits, but it will have a smaller impact on us than it did in the past, just given the mix.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nUnderstood. And my last question is for Charlie. I think your investors are receiving very warmly what you and Mike have said about you're trying to change how this bank is thinking by constantly identifying cost saves to fund future investments. And as we look out in what looks like a more favorable rate backdrop and revenue backdrop, from a growth perspective for banks, do you see yourself reinvesting more of the identified savings as we enter a more favorable revenue backdrop?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI guess the way I'd put it is we don't think about it relative to what the rate scenario is or how much we're making in NII. I think, again, just think about where we are in the stage of our evolution, which is we're limiting our investments based upon just what can physically be done, not based upon how much we actually want to spend. I mean, there are always a couple of small places around the place where people want to spend and you do have to prioritize. I think a lot of the answer to your question will have to do, as we continue to do our work strategically, to determine where we want to create additional capabilities across the company, we would expect the investment number to grow for sure.\nBut also, as you know, we're spending a lot of money on infrastructure. And I'm not talking about the risk build-out. I'm just talking about the basic infrastructure of the company. So I think as we sit here today, we still think that we have an opportunity to both become much more efficient and to continue to grow the level of investments that are going to drive business results inside the company.\nAnd that's I would say, is focused upon where we think we need to get to relative to how much money we should be spending as a company, as opposed to any upside that we had because of just the change in rates at this point.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. That's clear. Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd no reason I would add, I just think for us, that it takes the pressure off of us to think that if we were to think that way. If we were to say, OK, because if nothing we've done, rates have gone up, we then start spending a lot more money. As I said earlier, we're still in this phase of challenging ourselves to become as efficient as we should be. And having that pressure across the company at this stage for us is still a good thing, just as it is to challenge people to come up with where we should be investing.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nThanks Charlie.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. So I wanted to ask about the cap. And can you just remind us like where you are in the process from your perspective? Have you implemented everything that you submitted in your proposal and it's just a matter of consistently executing on those changes? Or are there still, call it, material changes that you're making to address those issues?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMatt, I understand you're very consistent in wanting to know the answer and I certainly appreciate that. We have, across all of this regulatory work. We still have a substantial amount to do. It's really not right for me to talk about under any specific consent order where we think we are in the process because, again, what I said ultimately is what's going to matter is whether our regulators believe it's done to their satisfaction.\nAnd it's really unhealthy to get into the game of do we think we're done? Do we think they're making the right conclusions? I think it's on us to continue to do all that's necessary. And when they're comfortable that we've satisfied those obligations, they will make that determination. And again, I'm sorry. I understand why you seek more detail, but it's just a difficult thing and probably not the right thing for us to get to that level of specificity.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nI appreciate that. And I know I ask this line of question kind of every quarter, but obviously, it's such a key part for the stock. And I know I've also asked this kind of follow-up question. I think you have like a slew of local regulators on site or at least on site virtually.\nBut I think there's a perception that it's kind of more of the central regulators that are kind of going to be the ones that make the call. And just remind us, in general, what is like the frequency of the dialogue with some more of those central regulators? And just any flavor you can add on the communication there?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI think it's fair that I think I would speak for most big banks that the level of dialogue with both local staff and with D.C. is substantial and meaningful. I mean, I can just tell you, even from my last role, it's the right thing to do. Again, we certainly have increased, I think, the level of dialogue that we have since the new team has gotten here.\nAnd it's hard to put specific how often we do it. But it's very, very regular. And I think it's true that all of the big banks, both the local staff as well as the staff in D.C. are both extremely important in their monitoring and the way they draw conclusions about the company.\nAnd we worked hard to treat both extremely respectfully. There's a very direct and open communication on their side as far as I can tell. And as I said, we say the same to the local people as we do to the D.C. staff.\nBut again, they're a very, very important part of the journey that we're on. And we want them to be as knowledgeable about what's going on here on all of these important issues. And we're always available and willing to have those conversations with them.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nGood morning guys. Thank you for taking the questions. Mike, I wanted to ask in a little bit more detail about rate positioning. I think I can figure this out mostly from your guidance disclosures but would still be curious to hear your thoughts.\nJust with your significant asset sensitivity, can you talk a little bit about sort of where you're most sensitive on the curve and sort of when and how you'll benefit like, put simply, is the first hike, the same benefit as the third and so on? Or when is it more or less powerful?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And to state the obvious, probably the short end of the curve is most meaningful, right? So when you look at just the whole curve shifting up, something like two-thirds of the benefit ends up being on the short end. And so that's going to be by far the most meaningful piece of it. I think for the first number of rate rises, it's hard to say exactly how many.\nI think the first three or four, though, it's pretty linear. And you can use our disclosures as a way to sort of model that. You get it earlier in the -- you get it in March, it's worth a quarter or more than if you get it in June and so forth. And so it's a pretty good guide at this point to use it that way.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK, perfect. And then just separately, so one of the criticisms on the story over the past few years is been that there are a number of competitors, a lot of smaller banks out there that sort of suggest that it's still pretty easy to steal talent and business from Wells Fargo. Your emerging loan growth seems to be running kind of contrary to what's been that argument for the last couple of years. Can you just sort of touch on that criticism and sort of where you are in terms of comfort with sort of stability and growth of the workforce?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Listen, we feel great about the people that we have here. And I've listened to that for quite a while since I've been here. And when I ask people for specifics, very little seems to come back.\nListen, it's a very, very competitive workplace. We lose people to competition. We hire people from competition of all sizes. I think I would say, as I've said before, when you look at the team that we have in place, both at a senior level all the way down to people that we cover customers, I feel great about it.\nAnd I can honestly tell you, I'm trying to remember, Mike, keep me honest here, if we sat around a room and talked about, \"Gee. Oh my God, look at all the people that we're losing to these smaller competitors and what are we going to do about it?\" That conversation hasn't happened. And we're very knowledgeable about attrition that's happening at the company. So if a small company hires a banker, it might be a big deal for them.\nWe're lucky enough to have a very broad set of coverage officers. But that's not to say it's not competitive. So maybe they're right, but we feel good about the people that are here, and we're going to work hard to keep the people that are here.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And I would just add a little color. We've been happy at what we've been able to recruit in places like the investment bank. We've hired almost a few like two to three dozen sort of relatively senior investment bankers.\nWe've hired a bunch of people in the commercial bank on the front line. And so I think as Charlie said, it's definitely competitive. And you could always find an anecdotal story of where somebody left to go do a bigger job at a smaller place or so forth. But I think the teams feel good about being able to attract good people into the roles.\nAnd so obviously, we've got to be competitive on pay. But I think people are attracted to the franchise and attracted to the sort of direction. And so far, it's been constructive there.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. And I just want to say one other thing, which is especially when you get down into places like the commercial bank and different businesses that cover consumers. As we've talked about having to improve the talent in some parts of the company, the talent that we have in those areas is really exceptional and it's really deep. And it's a huge strength of the company.\nIt's been a strength of the company for a very long time. So again, I think that might tell you just how we think about the people that we have. And again, we never want to lose good people, but it happens. But it's not something that we worry about hurting the franchise at this point.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nGood. Perfect. I appreciate the response. Thanks again.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. On the low single-digit to mid-single-digit loan growth assumption, can you give us a little more detail on how that breaks out among the products, either in core C&I versus commercial real estate and consumer? And then separately, are there any areas of the loan book that you're really emphasizing at this point or seeing opportunities to ramp your activity similar to what you've been doing on the credit card side?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look, it's a little bit of growth really across the board, John. And I think we're seeing opportunity really everywhere. And I think if you look at -- on the card side, we are expecting to see some growth in the card side.\nSome of that will be like through revolve balances. Some of that will be some of the intro balances coming off the new products, which will start to really pay off at the end of next year into the year after. We've been really happy with what we've seen in the auto space, which in this environment are pretty good assets, pretty short-lived assets and high quality in terms of what we've seen there. So we see some continued opportunity to grow there.\nAnd then on the consumer side, you have to go a little bit -- I'm sorry, on the mortgage side, you have to go a little bit below the covers. And if you look at the nonconforming space, we are seeing some growth there, which we think will continue as we go into the year. That's offset by these EPBO loans going away. But nonetheless, we see some growth there.\nI gave some color on the commercial banking stuff in my comments. And we do expect some more opportunity in the multifamily and apartments and asset classes like that in commercial real estate. So in places like commercial real estate, we're being really targeted about it. And even where you see a little limited growth in places like office in the quarter, and even in places like that, cash to equity ratios are up, structures are better, spreads are better, given sort of the way we're managing that.\nSo we're being really cautious in that space. But I do think it will be a little bit of growth across the board if we're successful.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK, great. That's helpful. And then separately, on the buyback front, buybacks came a little bit better than we had expected in the fourth quarter. Maybe if you can just give us your thoughts on the outlook there and your appetite buybacks and also how you're thinking about the dividend here in terms of deployment?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look, I think we've talked about this before, and we're maybe in a different spot than others, just given some of the constraints we have on the asset cap. But we still feel like we've got excess capital. You can see that in the numbers yourself.\nWe do expect that we'll continue to see some loan growth. So that will drive some RWA and we've got to be thoughtful about that. And so, as we laid out earlier last year, we said we would do at least $18 billion of buybacks through the four-quarter period ending in the second quarter. That still is achievable and we potentially have the opportunity to go above that if we decide that's the right path either this quarter or next quarter.\nSo we'll look at sort of how we feel with all the things we got to think about and make that decision. As you sort of think about the dividend, I think Charlie covered this a couple of times last year is, you think about a payout ratio that we hope to get to on a normalized basis to take out some of the onetime things that you see in the results, it's really kind of a 30% to 40% payout ratio is what we target over time. And that just takes some time to get there. And so I think ultimately, that's a board decision in terms of when and how much we increase the dividend.\nBut we're still marching down that path but it takes some time to get there.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks. I appreciate it.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from David Long of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGood morning everyone. You've talked in the past about the operating expense savings being a multiyear plan and/or initiative. And so with your guidance this year in the $51.5 billion range, should we be expecting 2023 operating expenses to still be below that level?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look, at this point, as we think about it, our goal would be to see a net reduction next year. I think we'll obviously give you more guidance on how that's progressing as we get toward the end of the year. And that will be a function of what we think we can invest properly and what inflation looks like and a whole bunch of factors.\nBut we're certainly given what our view on the efficiency side is targeting that, but we'll give you more guidance on that later in the year. I don't know if you have anything to add.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nOK. Great. And then as a follow-up, a little bit longer down the road, once the consent orders are mostly in the past, if you replace the cost today to improve and upgrade your internal operations with the expected cost to sort of just maintain proper controls and risk management for efforts, how much savings do you see there?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look, I think there is some savings there, but our focus now is getting the work done and getting all the stuff in place and making sure it's operating properly. And so we're focused a little bit -- we're being thoughtful about how we implement that stuff, but our focus is a little bit less on making it the most efficient and optimized process. So we will get there when that stuff is all done and running for a while, but that's a few years off, I think, in terms of really optimizing the risk and compliance.\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nGot it. Thanks Mike. I appreciate it.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. So just wanted to squeeze one more question in here just on the fee outlook. A fair amount of noise in the fee line this quarter, I know you didn't give an explicit fee guide for 2022.\nBut as we reflect the impact of business sales, the overdraft change, some weaker mortgage banking and normalization equity gains, how should we be thinking about the right jumping-off point for fee income, just looking ahead to next quarter and '22, just more broadly?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think you just outlined it, to be honest. I think you just have to take the lines, right? And I know we've talked about this on calls before. Like if you look at one of the biggest fee lines, you take the investment advisory and other asset-based fees, that's a function of our client assets and what the equity market is doing primarily. And so that's probably something that you can model.\nAnd that grew a bit as we went through the year last year. And then I think as you said, we're in the mortgage space, we'll see some -- the fourth quarter number in the consumer side is probably a good place to start your jumping-off point and modeling. And as I think others have spoken about too is we all expect the mortgage market to be down with refinancings really driving that. And how well we do will be a function of how well we're able to sort of penetrate on the purchase side.\nSo hopefully, we're down a little less than what the market is, but that will be a function of what we can deliver. And so I think you just got to take each of those lines and sort of model it forward.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nAnd maybe I'll just squeeze one more in, if I can. Just on the earlier discussion around excess liquidity deployment. It looked like you deployed some of that excess in the quarter. And yet, if I look relative to pre-pandemic levels, you've still seen a doubling of excess reserves and those deposits that you guys have on balance sheet, as you noted earlier, should be stickier as the Fed initiates QT just given some of the changes in deposit mix.\nI was hoping you could just size the amount of excess liquidity available for deployment today. And if the long end continues to grind higher, is there any appetite or willingness to deploy more aggressively than that mid-single-digit growth that's contemplated in the NII walk?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I mean, the first thing we'll be looking at is how fast loans are growing, right? So obviously, that's like the place you'd see that liquidity get deployed first to support customers. And so that will be a function of what we think is going to happen over a series of quarters. And I think when you look at the securities portfolio, we have done a lot in the last year, both in increasing our mortgage exposure, increasing our structured product CLO exposure.\nThe place that you saw the decline was really in the treasury side. And so given sort of what's happening in the rate environment. And so I think you will see us start deploying more. And as I mentioned earlier, we've started in a very small way already given sort of what we've seen over the last couple of weeks.\nAnd I think really how fast we go or how much we go will be both a function of what we think is going to happen with rates but also how fast we think loans will grow. And so those two things, I think, will drive sort of the pace. And at this point, embedded in our outlook or considerations there, we do expect a modest increase in the portfolio. And so we'll see how.\nWe'll make that determination based on all the factors there that I mentioned.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nVery helpful Mike. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator\nThe final question for today will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning guys. Charlie, you talked about joining the Net-Zero Alliance as with some of your peers. Can you frame out for us, as you guys get deeper into that and your peers do as well? How should we try to estimate what types of risks you might be coming up against? And how do you guys monitor those risks?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nListen, I think it's a great question. I think it's the question that everyone is asking. And I think the whole point about joining these alliances is to ensure that we're all benefiting from each other's experiences, and those that have experienced this in other parts of the world to understand how to actually think about that. What we're doing is we're going through how we think the impact of climate on a much longer-term basis can impact all of the different businesses from a risk perspective but also understanding where the opportunities for us are.\nAnd so whenever we talk about where we're going on climate with our goal to get to net zero, I think people too often jump to that means we're going to stop doing things. First of all, what we're trying to do is to assure that we're doing everything we can to help all of our clients transition. And that doesn't mean walking away from clients. It means helping them invest in areas, and we can do that in lots of different ways across the company with our own balance sheet or the public markets to invest in very, very different ways.\nAnd I think what you'll start to see from us and others is a lot more disclosure on what the embedded risks are, but also all the different things that we're doing to play our part in reducing emissions more broadly. So I just think it's a question that I think we should continue to ask as we all continue to provide more significant disclosures than we've all done in the past on the topic.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nI appreciate that. Thank you. And pivoting to the follow-up question on credit, obviously, your guys' credit is fantastic like the industry, considering what we just came through. Can you give us some color on the reserve? I assume as we normalize credit, you and your peers, how should we be looking at the reserve building in 2022 going into 2023, the loan loss reserve building, that is?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, let me start, Mike, and then you just pick up. I think the one thing I obviously, I think you guys all know this is not everyone starts at the same position when you look across what people have done with reserving across the industry. I think we feel very good about where we are relative to what we're seeing. We all have to make determinations.\nRemember, on a forward-looking basis as to what the embedded losses are. And I think everyone's got a different point of view on that on the way that looks. And I think we're doing the right thing, but I still think it's our assumptions are appropriate and conservative. And beyond that, remember, the idea of looking forward in terms of what's going to change in addition to just loan growth and making sure that we provide for growth in the balance sheet.\nIt's going to depend on the ultimate outcome of the performance of the economy. And so as we sit here today, we feel very, very good about it. But it can take lots of different turns. And hopefully, we're still insulated from some level of downturn from where we sit today, given the assumptions that we've made because of the uncertainty that exists in the environment.\nSo I'm not worried about where we are in 2022 personally, but I think as we look beyond that, it's a living breathing calculation.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nListen, thank you very much, everyone, for the time, and we appreciate it, and we will talk to you over the next quarter. Take care. Bye-bye.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 82 minutes\nCall participants:\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nMatt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nDavid Long -- Raymond James -- Analyst\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nMore WFC analysis\nAll earnings call transcripts"}

My name is Catherine, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]\nThank you. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn M. Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you, Catherine. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today, where our CEO, Charlie Scharf and our CFO, John Shrewsberry will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplement. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release and in the quarterly supplement available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie Scharf.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nGood morning. I'm going to open the call with comments on the current environment, the actions we're taking, our business performance and ongoing work to transform the Company. And John will provide more details on the first quarter results before we take your questions. Let me start some remarks about the current environment. I first want to start by saying that our thoughts are with those directly impacted by COVID-19. This includes those who have contracted the virus, healthcare workers who are on the front lines helping those directly impacted and all of those who provide essential services to ensure the country continues to function. As difficulty persists, the response by government, companies and individuals has been extraordinary. We understand that Wells Fargo plays an important role in providing stability to the financial system and the economy more broadly. And while there is still much to do, I'm incredibly proud of the efforts across the entire company, particularly those on the front lines.\nLet me start by discussing what Wells Fargo has done. First, I'll start with our customers. We've been aggressive in our actions to ensure we can better serve customers, while also prioritizing employee and customer safety. First on access, we temporarily closed approximately 1,400 branches, which is about one-fourth of our network nationwide, choosing locations to close based on the historical branch traffic and the physical design of each branch that would allow appropriate social distancing. Consumer and small business contact centers remain open in all other US locations to serve our customers, but wait times are higher. And we've deployed social distancing and safety measures in all sites to ensure we keep our employees safe. We've been rapidly expanding digital access and deploying new tools, including air limits for mobile deposits and wires, new digital mortgage deferment tools and expanded e-signature support. Customers are adopting these new tools as demonstrated by a 52% increase in dollar volume of mobile deposits in March 2020 versus March 2019.\nWe're providing significant credit to our clients. In the month of March alone, our commercial customers utilized over $80 billion of their loan commitments, and we're providing accommodations for clients that need. Through April 10, we helped more than 1.3 million consumers and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees. We deferred over 1 million payments, representing almost $2.8 billion of principal and interest payments and provided over 900,000 fee waivers exceeding $30 million. We've suspended residential property foreclosure sales, evictions and involuntary auto repossessions. And we continue to work with hub, the GSEs or trade groups, others in the industry, as well as government officials and not-for-profits to identify other ways to assist customers facing financial challenges in the current environment.\nWe've extended our participation in the PPP program and hope to provide significant relief to our small business customers. We are quickly ramping up our processing capacity to respond to the significant demand we've seen. Through April 10, we've received more than 370,000 indication of -- indications of interest from our customers. We are working with industry groups and the US Treasury in preparation to distribute millions of economic impact payments to Americans as quickly as possible. For those that receive checks, we've implemented changes to our ATMs and mobile app to make it more convenient to use those depository options instead of going into a branch.\nNow turning to how we're operating the Company and our employees. We have enabled approximately 180,000 employees to work remotely. For jobs that cannot be done through home in addition to modifying branch formats, we've taken significant actions to ensure safety, including enhancing social distancing measures, staggering staff and ships and implementing an enhanced cleaning program. We continue to pay all employees. We made a one-time cash award to approximately 165,000 employees who make less than $100,000. Additionally, as a way of recognizing muni contributions of our employees that work on the front line, we're making additional payments to those employees. We've made changes to our benefit plan to support those who are being tested or those who have the virus. To assist our employees who need child care, we granted eligible employees up to five paid business days off, so they can find child care. We're also providing financial support to eligible employees for those seeking child care through their own personal networks. And we made a $10 million grant to the We Care Employee Relief Fund, which is available to employees affected by coronavirus, especially those with limited resources to help them get back on their feet with basic necessities. And we're supporting our communities by directing $175 million in charitable donations from The Wells Fargo Foundation to help address food, shelter, small business, and housing stability as well as providing help to public health organizations fighting to contain the spread of COVID-19.\nTurning to what we've seen over the last month in the markets. As you all know, the health crisis has had a swift and severe impact on the financial markets, but the banks, including Wells Fargo are financially strong and have done a great job as many other industries have and providing continued service while many of our employees have been unable to access their offices. We also have navigated huge disruptions we saw in liquidity in most asset classes for several weeks. HQLA bid-ask spreads, daily volatility, and credit spreads increased 100% to 500% versus normalized levels prior to crisis. Activity remained reasonably order in HQLA, other loss remote credit assets and high-quality corporate primary issuance, but most other markets saw forced selling, high intraday volatility and bid-asks widening meaningfully. Bid programs designed to support smoothed market functioning and effective trends mission of monetary policy immediately improved risk pricing, increased dealer balance sheet capacity, decreased market volatility, and lower transaction costs. Large-scale asset purchases in treasuries and agency MBS improved secondary trading flows in HQLA, while credit-sensitive assets lagged the recovery. All of this, as well as the effective shut down of the economy directly impacted our results.\nTurning to the quarter. You can see that results were materially impacted by loan loss reserves, impairment of securities, and redemption of preferred securities. Our results included a reserve build of $3.1 billion for loans and debt securities, $950 million of securities impairment, predominantly related to equity securities, and a negative $0.06 impact related to the redemption of our Series K preferred stock. Within our Community Bank, as would be expected, branch traffic significantly slowed as March progressed. We had approximately half the teller volume at the end of March compared with the same period a year ago. ATM transactions were also down significantly, down approximately 17% in March, compared to a year ago. On the lending side, we originated $48 billion of residential mortgage loans, 52% for refinancing. Auto originations declined 5% from the fourth quarter with strong originations early in the quarter, more than offset by a slowdown in March. Credit card purchase volume was down 13% from the fourth quarter and down 1% from a year ago, a strong volume early in the quarter is more than offset by declines in March.\nWithin Wealth and Investment Management, period-end deposit balances increased 30% [Phonetic] during the quarter, driven by higher retail brokerage sweeps, reflecting higher client and cash allocations. Retail brokerage transaction revenue increased 12% from the prior quarter and despite market declines, Wells Fargo Asset Management AUM still grew 2% during the quarter, driven by strong inflows into money market funds.\nI'll turn to our wholesale businesses now. In trading, markets businesses were nice -- were up nicely year-over-year in the first two months of the quarter, but performance was mixed in March. We had strong performance in macro trading as well as in equities due to volatility and increased flows. However, our performance and spread products suffered due to the market dislocation. Commercial loans grew $52 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter. And overall global debt capital markets activity was the strongest on record, driven by high-grade offerings from U.S. issuers whose volumes were up 63% compared to a year ago. Wells Fargo's high-grade debt capital markets league table rankings improved from fourth to third, with 9.2% fee-based market share during the quarter.\nWhile focused on our efforts around COVID, we continue to make significant changes inside the Company. We continue to add talent to the senior leadership team. Ellen Patterson joined us several weeks ago as our General Counsel, and we expect several more additions to the team in the coming quarter. Even with the significant amount of time being voted to our COVID response, we're not reducing our efforts on our regulatory commitments, and we continue to move forward on improving the processes, structure, and cultural change necessary to get the work done. As a reminder, during the quarter, we announced new organizational structure with five lines of business reporting directly to me. I've also spoken of our business reviews we've had put in place. Those agendas have changed and are now oriented toward issues related to operating in the current stressed environment. As we settle into this environment and have some line of sight to the recovery, we will reengage with the work I discussed last quarter.\nWe turn to the asset cap now. John will provide more details on how we're managing in this environment, given the constraints, but here are some highlights. We are focused on doing all we can for our clients, while satisfying the requirements and to do this, we make decisions each day on balance sheet allocation. As a reminder, the asset cap is measured on a two-quarter daily average basis and must be below $1.952 trillion at the end of the quarter. On March 31, that calculation was estimated $1.943 trillion. In mid-March, as the crisis began to evolve, we first saw slow increases in deposits and drawdowns in committed lending facilities, and both of those accelerated as the crisis deepened. At the end of the quarter, we had $1.981 trillion in assets. John will discuss this in more detail, but we're taking a number of actions to ensure we stay below the cap. We started the quarter with a strong capital position, including a CET1 ratio of 11.1%. With the strong growth in assets during the quarter, materially wider spreads, as well as lower earnings, our CET1 ratio declined to 10.7%, still above the regulatory minimum of 9% and our current internal target of 10%. As you know, we suspended our share buyback as we focused on helping our customers get through these challenging times. I'm sure you still -- you'll want to discuss our capital plans going forward, but as you know, we submitted our 2020 capital plan earlier this month and the results will be published by the Federal Reserve Board in June.\nAs I think about what the future holds, here are few thoughts. We've entered into a world we haven't seen before. Much of the economy is essentially closed. Consumer spend is down over 25% year-over-year this past week, with food and drug increasing and other spend down significantly. New auto sales in the month of March were down 32% in February, manufacturing has turned downward with ISM March reading of 49.1%, as businesses cut back on orders, commodity prices are down 24%, speaking to the weakness in global demand. Unemployment is growing beyond what we've traditionally modeled, and while there is hope that this is time-bound by shelter-in-place orders, we don't know what the time frame is or how quickly the economy will recover when these orders are lifted. What we do know is the contraction is real and we must do all we can to be safe and to ensure we do our part to help recover as quickly as possible. It's equally important to note the response is also beyond what we've historically seen. Banks have provided significant amounts of credit liquidity, banks have deferred payments on loans, waived fees, made numerous other accommodations for customers in need. The response from the Federal Reserve has been fast, comprehensive in scope, and significant in size. And the response of Congress has been equally impressive and their actions are just beginning to provide the support necessary for many that will unfold quickly.\nThe question remains what this means for our future. What's important is controlling the spread of the virus, so the economy can reopen. We're hopeful that our actions, those of others and especially government support should provide needed relief and help many customers bridge this difficult period, but the length of the shutdown will ultimately determine the severity. What we do know is our strong levels of capital and liquidity position enable us to support our customers and the broader U.S. economy. We will be closely evaluating our assumptions regarding our allowance for credit losses as we move forward and the actual level of losses we incur will be driven by how long this period lasts and the effectiveness of the support from government and private industry. Sitting here today, there are many unknowns and the year will look quite different than we expected the last time we spoke, but as I said, we're focused on delivering for our customers and communities to get through these unprecedented times. And we remain committed to the financial and performance improvements we've discussed as we get beyond this crisis. Thanks again to all my partners at Wells Fargo that have been working tirelessly.\nAnd I'll pass it on to John.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Charlie and good morning everyone. Charlie covered the information provided in the initial pages of the supplement related to the actions we're taking to support our customers, employees and communities during the pandemic.\nSo I'm going to start on Page 6. As we highlight on this page, we had a number of significant items in the first quarter that impacted our results. We had $4 billion of provision expense for credit losses, reflecting the expected impact that these unprecedented times could have on our customers' credit worthiness. We had $950 million of securities impairment predominantly related to equity securities reflecting lower market valuations.\nWhile deferred compensation plan investment results did not meaningfully impact the bottom line, they increased net losses from equity securities by $621 million and reduced employee benefits expense by $598 million. We had $464 million of operating losses, which were down $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter that included elevated litigation accruals. We had $460 -- we had a $463 million gain on the sale of residential mortgage loans, which had previously been designated as held for sale. Mortgage banking income declined $404 million from the fourth quarter, driven by mark-to-market losses on loans held for sale and higher MSR asset valuation losses as a result of assumption updates primarily prepayment estimates. Finally, we redeemed our Series K preferred stock, which reduced EPS by $0.06 per share, as a result of the elimination of the purchase accounting discount recorded on these shares at the time of the Wachovia acquisition.\nEven after factoring in the COVID-19-related impacts experienced during the first quarter, as we highlight on Page 7, our CET1 ratio remained 170 basis points above the regulatory minimum and our LCR ratio was 21% above the regulatory minimum. These surpluses are noteworthy given the regulatory minimums they're based upon are established to ensure financial institutions maintain sufficient resources to withstand severely adverse economic and market conditions.\nTurning to Page 8. I'll be covering the income statement drivers throughout the call. But I want to highlight that our effective income tax rate was 19.5% in the first quarter and included net discrete income tax expense of $141 million. I'll be highlighting most of the balance sheet drivers on Page 9 throughout the call, but I will note here that the economic environment our customers are facing due to COVID-19 caused our balance sheet to expand as loan demand and deposit inflows increased significantly late in the first quarter.\nOn Page 10, we highlight how we're helping our customers while managing under the asset cap that's been in place since early 2018. Driven by strong loan demand -- loan growth in March, our total assets grew $53.8 billion from year-end to $1.981 trillion. As Charlie highlighted, even with this growth, we continue to operate in compliance with the asset cap of $1.952 trillion as compliance is measured at each quarter-end based on a two-quarter daily average. As of March 31, the two-quarter daily average for our assets was $1.943 trillion.\nDuring these challenging times, we expect loan and deposit growth could continue, but cannot provide guidance on the level of growth. And we're actively working to create balance sheet capacity to help our customers. It's worth noting that the high rate of growth at line utilization by our commercial clients is backed off since credit markets have reopened. We appreciate the targeted action the Federal Reserve took last week, which will provide additional flexibility for us to make small business loans as part of the Paycheck Protection Program and the forthcoming Main Street business lending program. We have and will continue to take actions to manage the size of our balance sheet. For example, we've exited Correspondent non-conforming mortgage originations, which gives us the ability to better meet the mortgage financing needs of our existing customers. And similar to the actions we took in early 2018, we're reducing the lower liquidity value deposits, particularly deposits from other financial institutions, and we've also reduced our securities finance footprint.\nLet's look at the drivers of the balance sheet growth we had in the first quarter, starting with average loans on Page 11. Average loans increased $8.5 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by commercial loans. Given the significant growth that occurred late in the quarter related to a change in borrowing behavior caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, I'm going to spend more time describing period-end trends starting on Page 12. Period-end loans increased $61.6 billion or 6% from a year ago and $47.6 billion or 5% from the fourth quarter. Commercial loans grew $52 billion or 10% from the fourth quarter as balance sheet declines early in the first quarter were more than offset by strong growth late in the quarter. The growth in commercial loans in the first quarter included more than $80 billion of borrower draw activity in the month of March on commercial banking and corporate investment banking loans. Revolving loan utilization in Wholesale Banking was 48.6% in March, up 860 basis points from December. And as I mentioned, during the first two weeks of April, we've seen these draws slow. Consumer loans were down $4.4 billion or 1% from the fourth quarter as declines in credit card loans, consumer real estate loans and other revolving loans were partially offset by growth in auto loans.\nI'll highlight the drivers of the linked-quarter trends in more detail starting on Page 13. The first mortgage loan portfolio decreased $927 million from the prior quarter as refinancing-led paydowns more than offset $14.3 billion of held-for-investment mortgage loan originations. Junior lien mortgage loans were down $982 million from the fourth quarter as continued paydowns more than offset new originations and $1.8 billion of draws on existing lines, which was up meaningfully late in the first quarter. Credit card loans declined $2.4 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by seasonality and fewer new account openings. our Auto portfolio continued to grow, while we maintained our credit discipline with balances up $695 million from the fourth quarter. However, as Charlie highlighted, originations declined 5% from the fourth quarter, with strong originations in the first quarter -- early in the first quarter, more than offset by a slowdown in March due to the pandemic.\nTurning to commercial loans on Page 14. C&I loans were up $50.9 billion from the fourth quarter with broad-based growth across business lines, largely driven by draws of revolving lines as clients reacted to the economic slowdown associated with the pandemic. Commercial real estate loans were up $1.8 billion from the fourth quarter, with growth in both CRE mortgage and construction loans. Given the focus on commercial loan draws and exposure to industries that have been particularly hard hit as a result of the pandemic, we're providing more details on certain of our industry exposures starting on Page 15. We typically disclose the industry breakdown of our C&I and lease financing portfolio in our quarterly SEC filings, but are also providing the industry breakdown of our total commitments on this slide. I'd note that not all unfunded loan commitments are unilaterally exercisable by borrowers. For example, certain revolvers contain features that require the customer to post additional collateral in order to access the full amount of the commitment.\nWhile many areas of the economy are being impacted by the pandemic, the next few slides provide details on the industries with escalated monitoring. Starting with oil and gas on Page 16, as of March 31, we had $14.3 billion of loans outstanding to the oil and gas industry. The size of our portfolio was down 20% from $17.8 billion in the first quarter of 2016, which was also when oil prices were low. As of the end of the first quarter, 47% of our portfolio were loans to the exploration and production sector; 41% to midstream; and 12% to services. I'll provide more detail on the performance of this portfolio later on the call. We had $27.8 billion of retail loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter, which included $5.8 billion to restaurants. This includes $3.9 billion to limited service restaurants commonly referred to as fast food restaurants typically with the drive-thru, which have been -- which have largely remained open across the country, while other restaurant formats have been more impacted with service limited to delivery or pickup.\nTurning to the entertainment and recreation industry on Slide 17. We had a total of $16.2 billion of loans outstanding at the end of the first quarter with less than 1% to cruise lines. We had $11.9 billion of loans outstanding to the transportation industry as of March 31, which included $2.4 billion to air transportation. We're also closely monitoring our commercial real estate portfolio, which we highlight on Slide 18. At the end of the first quarter, we had $14.1 billion of loans outstanding to retail, excluding shopping centers with our commercial real estate mortgage -- within the commercial real estate mortgage portfolio and $10.6 billion in loans outstanding for the hotel, motel industry. Within our $20.8 billion construction portfolio, we had $7.1 billion of loans outstanding in apartments.\nTurning to deposits on Page 19, average deposits increased 6% from a year ago and 1% from the fourth quarter. Typically we experienced linked quarter seasonal declines in average deposits at our Wholesale Banking and WIM business, but all of our deposit gathering businesses grew in the first quarter. This growth included the late quarter impacts of flight-to-quality deposits across all business lines following the emergence of COVID-19, as well as the inflow of deposits associated with corporate and commercial loan draws. Our average deposit costs declined 10 basis points from the fourth quarter with declines across all of our major -- all of our lines of business. We had larger declines in Wholesale Banking and WIM, while our Retail Banking deposit costs declined at a slower pace, as they were lower to begin with and continue to be impacted from promotional pricing in early 2019, most of which will expire in the second quarter.\nOn Page 20, we provide details on period-end deposits, which better reflect the strong growth we had at the end of the first quarter with total deposits up $53.9 billion or 4% from year-end. Wholesale Banking deposits were up $13.5 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by Commercial Banking and commercial real estate revolving line draws, partially offset by lower financial institutions' deposits, reflecting actions taken to manage the asset cap. Consumer & Small Business Banking deposits increased $41.1 billion or 5% from the fourth quarter, including higher retail banking deposits, largely driven by growth in high-yield savings in interest-bearing checking. Wealth and Investment Management deposit growth was driven by higher cash balances from brokerage clients.\nNet interest income increased $112 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting $356 million higher hedge ineffectiveness accounting results attributable to the level of market rates and differences in basis and notional on swaps hedging our long-term debt; $84 million of lower MBS premium amortization, resulting from lower realized prepays, partially offset by balance sheet repricing, including the impact of the lower interest rate environment as our assets repriced down faster than our liabilities and from one fewer day in the quarter. The low rate environment could continue to put pressure on our net interest income, but we're managing our interest rate exposure to minimize the impact as much as possible. Given the current market volatility and uncertainty, we are withdrawing our prior 2020 net interest income guidance. While we're currently not providing guidance on our expectations for net interest income for this year, we will provide more insights regarding developments throughout the year.\nTurning to Page 22, non-interest income declined $2.3 billion from the fourth quarter, driven by a $1.9 billion decline in net gains from equity securities and $404 million of lower mortgage banking income. Let me explain these declines in more detail, starting with mortgage banking. Lower mortgage banking income reflected unrealized losses of approximately $143 million on residential loans and $62 million on commercial loans held for sale due to illiquid market conditions and a widening of credit spreads. This impact is recorded in net gain on mortgage loan originations and the $143 million loss reduced the production margin we report on residential held for sale originations. Absent this impact, our production margin would have increased as origination demand exceeded capacity during the first quarter. Mortgage banking results also reflected a $192 million of higher losses on the valuation of our MSR asset as a result of assumption updates, primarily prepayment estimates. I would note that we ended the first quarter with a $62 billion of mortgage loan application pipeline, which was up $29 billion or 88% from the fourth quarter.\nWe provided details on the net losses from equity securities on Page 23. We had $1.4 billion of net losses from equity securities in the quarter, which included $621 million of largely P&L neutral deferred comp plan investment losses. Net losses from equity securities also included $935 million of impairments, reflecting lower market valuation. The impairments on venture capital, private equity, and certain wholesale businesses represented 17% of the carrying values of these businesses' portfolio investments subject to the impairment assessment.\nTurning to expenses on Page 24, our expenses declined $2.6 billion from the fourth quarter. Operating losses declined $1.5 billion from the fourth quarter, which included elevation -- elevated litigation accruals. Personnel expense, which is typically seasonally elevated in the first quarter, declined $494 million from the fourth quarter, driven by lower employee benefits expense. The decline in employee benefits expense was driven by $861 million of lower deferred comp expense, which was partially offset by $544 million of seasonally higher payroll taxes and 401(K) matching expenses. We also had lower expenses in a variety of other areas, including commission and incentive comp, outside professional services, technology and equipment, and as you would expect, travel and entertainment. The enhanced benefits and payments we provided to employees in March as part of our response to COVID-19 did not meaningfully impact our expenses in the first quarter, but we currently expect that they will have a greater impact beginning in the second quarter and through the remainder of this year. While these costs will add to our expense base, the actions we took were the right thing to do to support our employees.\nBefore discussing our business segment starting on Page 25, I want to note that as a result of the new flatter organizational structure that was announced in February, we will be updating our operating segments when we complete the transition and are managed in accordance with the new five business segment structures. Community Banking earnings declined $274 million from the fourth quarter, reflecting higher provision expense as well as net losses from equity securities. On Page 26, we provide our Community Banking metrics. I'll start by noting that as always our digital, mobile, and primary consuming checking customers are reported on a one-month lag, so the numbers reported here for first quarter, did not capture the change in customer behavior we experienced in March due to COVID-19. For example, our customers have shifted to depositing checks through our mobile app and the dollar volume of mobile checks deposited increased over 40% in March, compared with February.\nTurning to Page 27, teller and ATM transactions are reported through March, which is when we reduced our branch hours and temporarily closed approximately one-fourth of our branches as a result of COVID-19, which resulted in an approximate 50% decline in teller volume during the final weeks of the first quarter, compared with a year ago. Our customers also meaningfully reduced their card spending late in the first quarter due to the impact of the pandemic. During the first two months of the year, credit card volumes were up from a year ago, while March 2020 volumes declined approximately 15% from March 2019, resulting in first quarter credit card purchase volumes being down 1% from a year ago. We also had meaningful shifts in customer spending in March with the grocery and pharmacy spending increasing, while all other categories were down from a year ago. Debit card spending trends were similarly impacted, but the change in spend was less significant with year-over-year growth in January and February and a 5% decline in year-over-year volumes in March. Similar to credit card, debit card spending shifted significantly to grocery in March, but the growth in this category started to slow in the last week of the month.\nTurning to Page 28, Wholesale Banking earnings declined $2.2 billion from the fourth quarter, reflecting a $2.2 billion increase in provision expense. I've already highlighted the strong loan and deposit growth from our commercial customers in the first quarter and we also raised $47 billion of debt capital for our clients. Wealth and Investment Management earnings increased $209 million from the fourth quarter. During the first quarter, we experienced strong demand from clients for liquid products. Period-end deposit balances increased 13% from the fourth quarter, reflecting a higher cash allocation and brokerage client assets. And assets under management in our Wells Fargo Asset Management business grew significantly, driven by over $34 billion of inflows into our money market funds. Despite the market volatility, closed referred investment assets into WIM from the Consumer Bank partnership increased on a linked quarter and year-over-year basis and flows into our retail brokerage advisory business remained positive in the first quarter. As a reminder, retail brokerage advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter. So, first quarter results reflected market valuations as of January 1 and second quarter results will reflect market valuations as of April 1.\nTurning to Page 30, our net charge-off rate was up 6 basis points from the fourth quarter to 38 basis points, predominantly driven by higher C&I losses, primarily related to higher losses in our oil and gas portfolio, reflecting significant declines in oil prices. We had net recoveries in all of our commercial and consumer real estate portfolios and lower losses in our auto portfolio. The increase in credit card losses from the fourth quarter included seasonality. Non-accrual loans increased $810 million from the fourth quarter to 61 basis points of total loans, which was up 5 basis points from the fourth quarter and down 12 basis points from a year ago. Commercial non-accruals increased $621 million, predominantly driven by the economic impact of the pandemic. Consumer non-accrual increased $189 million, predominantly driven by higher non-accruals in the real estate 1-to-4 family first mortgage loan portfolio as the implementation of CECL required PCI loans to be classified as non-accruing based on performance.\nOn Page 31, we provide detail on the performance of our oil and gas portfolio. Oil and gas loans outstanding increased 5% linked quarter and 7% from a year ago, reflecting increased utilization rates, driven by the impact of COVID-19 and the decline in oil prices. Total commitments declined, reflecting a weaker credit environment. The significant decline in oil prices in the first quarter resulted in early signs of credit deterioration, particularly in the E&P sector. Total oil and gas net charge-offs increased $112 million in the first quarter to $186 million. Non-accruals declined $66 million from the fourth quarter, due to the higher net charge-offs as well as paydowns, partially offset by new downgrades to non-accrual status in the first quarter. Approximately 84% of non-accrual loans were current on payments during the quarter. Criticized loans increased 23% from the fourth quarter, predominantly reflecting increases in the E&P sector.\nOn Page 32, we highlight our adoption of CECL. At the end of the first quarter, the allowance for loans and debt securities was $12.2 billion. $12 billion of this allowance was for loans and unfunded commitments. And our allowance coverage ratio was 1.19% of loans. We added $3.1 billion to our allowance for credit losses since the adoption of CECL on January 1. This increase was driven by a number of factors, including economic sensitivity due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the estimated impact to industries most adversely affected by the pandemic, our exposure to the oil and gas industry, draws on loan commitments during the quarter, which were the primary driver of commercial loan growth, and $141 million reserve build for debt securities reflecting economic and market conditions.\nTurning to capital on Page 33. Even after a multi-year program to return excess capital to shareholders, our CET1 ratio was 10.7% at the end of the first quarter, which continued to be above the regulatory minimum of 9% and our current internal target of 10%. Our period-end common shares outstanding were down 38 million shares from the fourth quarter. On March 15, we, along with the other members of the Financial Services Forum, suspended share repurchases through the end of the second quarter.\nIn summary, while our results in the first quarter were impacted by the economic and market uncertainty caused by the pandemic, we maintained strong liquidity and capital. Our priority is to continue to use our financial strength to help the US economy by serving our customers, supporting our employees and delegating to our communities. And Charlie and I will now take your questions.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nOperator, do you want to open it up for questions?\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator Instructions]\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nOperator, how are we doing?\nOperator\nYour first question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nHi, Ken.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies LLC -- Analyst\nHi, good morning guys. Thanks a lot for the color and the deck today. Can I just ask you -- John, can you elaborate a little bit more in terms of -- it was good to see the Fed giving you some flexibility to participate in the programs on lending, but can you elaborate a little bit more on -- are you truly able to provide all the help that your customers are asking for and how are you balancing that demand function on behalf of clients with the magnitude that you have to dial back and the effects that might have on the Company from an income statement perspective? Thanks.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. Yeah. Thank you. So on the PPP front, which was the targeted action that -- where the Fed gave us a little extra flexibility, there, I would describe this as unconstrained and in a position to help everybody who approaches us subject to the program, of course, having sufficient funding from a legislative perspective, but no constraints at Wells Fargo.\nWith respect to the other trade-offs, as I mentioned, the first places that we're going to be able to create more capacity to help customers are to reduce non-operational deposits principally in the financial institutions area where we're relatively easily substitutable, and it's a low value use of cap balance sheet because it's a high run-off factor on those types of deposits. And there are tens of billions of dollars of those types of deposits to continue to work down. And then, secondly, our securities financing footprint or I would describe that as -- is that plus different sources of wholesale funding, this -- we did this in 2018 when the cap was originally put in place, but we've dialed back some of the repo financing and other securities financing that we provide and then, our own utilization of external repo as a financing source to create more room and that -- where some of those activities is first and foremost gets us down below the gap on a spot basis, but then we will create some amount of room for us to make choices about how to help our customers and it starts with existing customers and making sure that we can meet their needs, and that's what we're focused on right now.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nKen, this is Charlie. I just -- I know you didn't mean it this way. And I just want to make sure that it's clear for everyone else is that we have no restrictions on participating in these programs. What the Fed did is they allowed us to go above the existing balance sheet cap, so that we could participate in a more holistic way without having to adjust other items, which as you know is difficult to do in a shorter period of time. So it provided us the flexibility to do far more than we had chosen to do ourselves based upon our capacity.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies LLC -- Analyst\nYeah, exactly. Thank you, Charlie. And second question, John, understanding fully the pulling away from giving full-year guidance, is there a way you can help us understand on the NII front just how you'd expect trajectory at least go from first to second, given the changes and all the moving parts that were in this quarter's results? Thanks.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nYeah, it's a fair question, but not quite yet. We've got to the -- I think we're all forecasting something like zero in the front-end or with -- depending on where LIBOR moves over time and then some number between, call it, 70 basis points and 100 basis points at the long end. What -- how the deposit pricing reacts to that and it came down in this quarter and we anticipated coming down rapidly over the course of the remainder of the year will be a big driver. What of these recent balances that we just booked stick versus those that dialed back down, I think, will be a big driver. So, not looking for NII growth, and I'm sure it will be down by some amount, but we're not being any more precise and hopefully by the time we get to either mid or at the end of the second quarter, we'll be in a position to be a little bit more declarative about that.\nAnalyst\nYeah, I appreciate that. Thanks, guys.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nThank you.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nHi, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. A couple of questions. One, just on the outlook for CECL and the CECL charges. I mean, I know you obviously went through in detail what you did this most recent quarter. But I'm just trying to understand what kind of unemployment level you're assuming in that just so, if we see a trajectory differently from your assumptions, we know how to think about reserve builds from here.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nYeah. So, it's a combination of things, including unemployment, but to what level and then for how long and then the same with GDP, obviously, other things that are going to matter are what this stimulus means at the personal level and at the business level and whether that's an effective offset to the impact on consumer credit from unemployment. So, our scenarios and there's a few of them that we're relying on, and we have different weights on each basically are sort of high-single digits sustained down GDP and sustained unemployment really through 2021. Well, I take it back, we get flat to GDP in 2021, but really not much growth. So, quite elongated in terms of the U shape. Hopefully, that's helpful. And we will update as we go along. We're a little less relying on sharp spikes and sharp recoveries and thinking about this a little bit more is a long slow burn over the next couple of years for risk management purposes.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. And then if I could drill down just on the oil side, I mean, obviously, we went through an oil event several years ago, it was like 2016, and you had some workouts around that, brought down the oil exposure or the gas exposure since then. Maybe you can give us a sense as to how you're thinking about this go round, I mean the price is obviously a little bit lower, but I'm thinking that your book has changed a bit. Maybe you could give us some color on how you're dealing with that portfolio and what your expectations are there.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nThanks. And the book does look different. So, on the one hand, it's smaller, on the other hand, it's a little bit -- it's more senior. We had a bigger weight on lowering the capital structure activity before going into the 2015/2016 downturn. We are imagining, because of the levels of the resource price, that losses given defaults are substantially worse this time through. In terms of the migration of performing and non-performing, I'd say, in our own credit loss analysis, we're assuming basically across the board full-notch downgrade type of -- in our own estimation of default probability. And I think we're approaching it in a pretty sober basis. We've got a good number on it now, both specifically and through our qualitative reserve, and we'll continue I think to up our disclosure around it like we did in 2015/2016 as we work through that.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOkay. But that's embedded within your CECL estimate today already. So if it pans out as expected, we wouldn't expect to see any more reserve build on that specific asset class?\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nYeah. Well, so yes and no. We always end up reserving more than we end up charging off. So, when I'm thinking about that through this cycle charge-off, my sense is we have a line of sight on how we expect it to perform, but for any number of reasons, we do -- and CECL is different than the prior methodology, but I'm not surprised when we lean in a little hard and it turns out that cumulative losses were less than the allocated number. It just seems to work out that way.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nThanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Anonymous [Phonetic] Research.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHi, John, Charlie. John, I was wondering if you could give any more color on the kind of base case economic scenario that you've baked into the first quarter reserve build and given that, what kind of macro scenario would have to materialize in the second quarter for you to have a similar size provision or to be adding more than you added in the first quarter? And then maybe Charlie could just add some thoughts on the potential path you see for this credit cycle relative to what you've seen in your career trolley. What are some of those similarities and differences you think about how this might play out relative to great financial crisis or stress test scenarios? Thank you.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo, I'll go first, and John it's still Autonomous Research right, not Anonymous Research?\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nYes, thank you.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, make sure we get that right. So, as I mentioned to Betsy, we're taking kind of a longer window approach rather than a quick V or even a quick U when thinking about growth through the rest of the year and into next year being mid- to high-single digits negative this year and flattening out, but not growing really next year and then unemployment in the long and sustained high-single digit range. They may vary -- there already have been perhaps spikes that go beyond that, but we're thinking about this as it plays out quarter-after-quarter. So, just to mention it compared to other scenarios thinking about both our performance in the financial crisis as well as our own CCAR severely adverse scenarios, at this point, we see this as not generating that level of loss in our own CCAR severely adverse scenarios. I think we produced nine quarter credit losses of about 2.75% [Phonetic] in total with peak quarterly loss rates expressed on an annualized basis of about 1.7%, 1.75% and an average of about 1.2%. That's got a steeper drop in GDP and a steeper climb in unemployment and importantly no stimulus baked into the severely adverse case, it's -- it doesn't anticipate the types of interventions that we've already seen and we're waiting to see materialize.\nAnd with respect to the financial crisis as a benchmark, importantly, at least for Wells Fargo, it may be true for other banks as well, but loan portfolios were very different than the quality of loans, particularly on the single-family side was worse. I think our auto portfolio was worse then too. And so there, we did produce higher -- somewhat higher loss rates, even higher loss rates than we do today in our own CCAR analysis, because the content of the portfolio is different, but I guess I would describe that we're currently imagining now to be, I'll call it, half-ish of an annualized loss rate of the severely adverse version of our own stress test.\nAnd so, if things play out substantially worse, then there is certainly the possibility that we end up building more or experiencing more charge-offs or both, but we feel good about the approach that we've taken in March, developing our scenarios with our governance around it and coming into the quarter-end.\nAnd Charlie, you may have comments on the comparability.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nYeah. Listen, I think as I said in my remarks, I think it's -- we all know we haven't seen anything like this before. There is no clear path to with a -- with any narrow range of outcomes for what unemployment or GDP will be. I mean, when we think about different people's estimates, I mean, you can see GDP differences of 10 points, 20 points across very smart people who do this for a living. Same thing with unemployment, 5 points, 10 points differences. And so, making an analogy of what this environment is to other environments, I just have a very hard time doing. Having said that, I think we feel like the portfolios that we have are stronger than they were at other downturns as I think they certainly are in many banks out there. The real question will ultimately be how long this shutdown actually continues, which again, none of us know, but in addition to that, how our actions, whether it's the forbearance plans that we have or the fee waivers, the things that we're doing very, very actively to help our clients and the huge amount of government intervention, whether those things will actually be able to bridge individuals and small businesses and larger corporations to the other side of this. I personally wouldn't be surprised that as the earning cycle continues and as we start to see these numbers, even though people are talking about big numbers, they'll potentially continue to be surprised by the size of them and that will create additional volatility in the environment that we live in, and it wouldn't surprise me to continue to have to add to reserves as those things impact confidence and ultimately what economic growth looks like. But as I said, I think it's different. And again what we know is, we're strong and the industry is strong to be able to handle this.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nGreat. And as a quick follow-up to that, Charlie, the idea of banks maintaining dividend payment is a big debate right now, not just for Wells Fargo, but for the industry overall and you've cut the majority of distributions you and other banks. Two-thirds of it has been buybacks and folks talk about the importance of dividends that are signaling. Can you talk about the pros and cons of keeping the dividends for yourself in the industry?\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nWell, listen, I think certainly, the dividends are certainly important for all of those that own the stock, and ultimately those that wind up benefiting from stock ownership or for individuals in one way or another, whether it's direct holdings or whether it's pension plans and things like that. And so, I think the income stream that people come to rely on, especially, in times like this is important, but there has to be an underlying ability for companies to be able to pay. And so, to the extent that they have that ability to pay, I certainly think it's the right thing to do for the reason today that I just said.\nWe have strong capital ratios. We do all the stress test and whatnot that John referred to and determine our ability to return capital in this severely stressed environment. Also remind you that for us, we are slightly different than others because of the balance sheet cap. So our balance sheet cap does limit our ability to deploy capitally -- to deploy capital internally. And so, based on that, that's why we sit here and look at and say that we think the dividends certainly that we're paying makes sense. But as I alluded in my prior comments, we don't know what the future looks like. Based upon the assumptions that we've laid out in these very stressed environments, we do feel good about it, but ultimately, the timing and the pace of the recovery is going to determine earnings capacity for everyone to be able to continue to support the level of dividends.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nThanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nGood morning, Erika.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. I just wanted to ask a clarifying question on John's question on the dividend because it is a question that investors are asking a lot about Wells Fargo specifically. So before you reported earnings, consensus was at $2.35 for this year versus dividends of $2.04. And I just wanted to make sure I'm taking away the right message and that the market should really look at the payout and instead, given that the bright line on capital distributions would be breaking that 9% CET1, we would continue to monitor where your capital levels are relative to the minimum. And because of the balance sheet restriction unlike some peers, you are less able to eat through your capital through RWA growth. Is that the right way to think about the dividend going forward?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nI think that's right. I'd also -- I'd add to Charlie's view though that as good quarters unfold and we figure out how long we're going to be in this economic state and what the path forward looks like and we use that to interpret and estimate what our go-forward earnings trajectory looks like, that's the context for understanding what the steady state dividend should look like.\nSo in terms of what this year's dividend looks like versus this year's consensus or estimated earnings during a time of stress is less germane I think than then A) the fact that we start with ample capital and B) what we think our run rate, more steady state earnings are on the way out of this and reflects what the dividend is in light of that. So if that's helpful. But yes, the point that Charlie was making about the fact that we're not really in a position to go out and generate substantial incremental RWA through outsized loan origination. There is an important one and a distinguishing one versus others who may be doing that right now and expanding the balance sheet intentionally.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. And my second question is on forbearance, and just a clarification question also on something that you said, John. So, if possible, could you give us some update on how many of your clients, if you could give it to us like by mortgage, by auto are in the 90-day or 60-day forbearance period, how April 1st payment behavior was like? And also just clarify what you said John, you said that potentially the losses -- the cumulative loss of this cycle would be 50% of this severely adverse, which I think for nine quarters was $26 billion?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. What I said was that the current loss rates that are in the scenario that we're talking through are in the neighborhood of half of our current severely adverse. I think you're probably looking at last year. And so, I'm not making a call on the cumulative level of losses. I'm just making the point that as a benchmark and answer in response to John's question for contractually like what is bad really look like. In that instance over nine quarters, we generated a calculated 2.75% [Phonetic] aggregate credit loss. And for context in terms of where we are now, these loss rates are lower than that by more than half -- roughly half, but I'm not predicting that we're going to go through a cycle like our own severely adverse -- stress test cycle that lasts for nine quarters and goes that deep, etc. just providing a benchmark.\nWith respect to deferrals, I think we're -- and I'm now in deferrals. I'm including both loans on our own books as well as loans that we service for others, because the customers don't distinguish when they call Wells Fargo. And I think at this point, we've had requests for deferring over 1 million payments. It's about $3 billion worth of P&I. I think about 20% of that relates to loans on our own books and 80% of it is loans serviced for others. It's disproportionately auto and mortgage; the dollars of course are mortgage, because the P&I is bigger there than it is on an auto loan.\nI don't have the specifics in front of me beyond that, but that's what it amounts to. And then, it's probably worth mentioning that at least with respect to the loans on our own books that we would be deferring interest into the future and recognizing interest revenue on an effective interest basis, which would reduce the amount of interest income in the current period by some amount. It's not at this point seem to be a large amount. We'll give updates on that at this number flattens out at some point, and we calculate all of the P&I and effective yield, but I don't think it's going to be a huge difference maker in terms of our interest income recognition for the year.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Erika.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler.\nR. Scott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nGood morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. John, I think you mentioned at one point during the call, there has perhaps been a little bit of a bidding in the pace of line of credit trials. I wonder, if you can just talk to what you've been seeing since the quarter-end. I guess it stands to reason that with the quarter ending and your customers maybe doing some window dressing, there would be less need for line of credit draws, but how is that actually trending and where -- how would you expect those balances to behave? Is that cash actually getting used or are you seeing it just indeed and redeposit back into the bank? What are the phenomenon at work there?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So those daily monitor, those daily draws just to understand what's happening by industry, by customer, by customer type, etc. And they really have flattened out. And they have been negligible for the last several days, more than a week. And so, they peaked probably at the end of the third week in April and then -- pardon in March and then came right back down. So, not growing at anything like that pace. So the related question of how long do they stick is a good one. And I guess, it depends on the reason for the drive to begin with, whether it was window dressing, whether it was a need to access credit markets which -- some of which had been closed and some of which are more or less open high-grade market wide open obviously.\nBut for people who need to go into the syndicated loan market as the high yield market, it's a little bit more by appointment depending on their story. There, where people who drew -- because of just a hardcore liquidity preference and they wanted to have quick access to the cash regardless of the messaging that they were sending to their external stakeholders, and they may continue to have that preference for liquidity until told people know when the economy is going to open back up and depending on the nature of the borrower, what it means for their sales forecast. And so, I don't think we've seen any meaningful paydowns yet. And as I've mentioned in response to the question about NII guidance whether or not those balances remain outstanding will have an impact on this quarter one way or the other and currently, they are sticking. So -- but they're not really growing.\nR. Scott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOkay, perfect. Thank you. And then if I can ask a second question, just in the -- on Slide 15, where you go through this C&I loans by bucket, can you talk a little bit about the financials except banks portfolio? I know you've discussed it in the past, but just given all the turmoil there has been in some of the non-bank areas, just maybe a little color and sort of what we should be thinking about that.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So the buckets of activity there, there is CLO-related activity, so credit managers, there is subscription finance, where we're providing leverage to alternative asset managers against the commitments of their limited partners to fund when called, there is leasing, there is auto, there is card, there is mortgage, there is commercial mortgage, etc. I'm sure we'll see a little bit more stress in the system. As it relates to the loan balances, they by and large tend to be the highest quality loan balances on a ratings basis -- or among the highest quality that we have because they're generally credit-enhanced pools of cross-collateralized receivables of one form or another and that's a huge benefit to us compared to the average portfolio of whole loans, where you have the first dollar of loss if something goes bad in a loan.\nHaving said that, these types of customers will have stress often in their origination function, if they're an originator, or in their ongoing capital accumulation, if they're an asset manager. There can be stress on the servicing side of this for those that are residential mortgage-oriented. Their life is going to be a little bit harder presumably as servicing, servicing advances, default servicing and things like that pop up, and so we're managing them in that way.\nOn the CLO front, which is a big distinguishing portfolio for Wells Fargo, in addition to what's here, there is a little bit of overlap, but also in our securities portfolio, we have $30-ish billion worth of CLO exposure disproportionately, top of the capital structure, AAA, AA that can withstand an extraordinary, almost a complete level of cumulative default with varying levels of loss given default and we're still very comfortable with that and 80% of that portfolio is externally rated AAA, which I think is a plus. So, haven't been meaningful signs of stress here. We will talk about it. If it [Technical Issues] we actively manage it in our allowance calculations and these are very actively managed borrower relationships as I mentioned.\nAnalyst\nOkay. That's perfect. I appreciate all the color. So thank you for taking the questions.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, you bet.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHi, Saul.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nHey, how are you guys? Thanks for taking my questions. I Wanted to tackle a couple of things really quickly. First, the interplay of credit in CECL. So, you trued up -- you took up your reserves, obviously, and your ACL ratio is roughly about 120 basis points. And this is probably oversimplifying it, but one way to think about that ratio under CECL is it's an estimate of what you think you're going to lose on the entirety of your loan book over the life of the loan at any given point in time, and that number is lower than what it is for all -- for any other large bank even as of January 1. So, I kind of want to get your perspective on how much of that you think is a reflection of just you guys having lower loss content loans, a better risk profile of it as opposed to maybe some other more idiosyncratic things as I seem to recall that you've marked some loans in the past that were in recovery positions and stuff like that. So -- and I ask also just because I do get that question occasionally from investors asking if you're underserved relative to your peers, which I don't think is the case, but I kind of wanted to get your perspective on this.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I think it's a good question and I think loan mix has a lot to do with it. The question about mark-to-loans historically would have been true, but with the adoption of CECL, most of those marks had to be reversed, which was the source of a portion of our day one adoption of a negative number. So we don't have that to rely on although we used to. I think the biggest difference is probably the weights that we have on jumbo mortgage versus the weight that we have on credit card on a heads-up basis versus other peers, and that's true of both outstanding as well as undrawn and the allowance is there to serve both our credit card portfolio, which under most conditions, we wish was a bigger capability for Wells Fargo at times like this is a little bit of a saving grace, because we expected loss content, both in what's outstanding as well as what might be expected to come through from undrawn is more manageable in the size of our balance sheet. But still, as you'd expect, the higher loss content, higher loss rate exposure, because it's consumer unsecured and unemployment will be a big driver of losses in this cycle or any cycle, but on the first lien mortgage front, because that business has changed so much in between borrower capacity to repay reserves, LTVs, etc., even in stress, our loss estimations for that portfolio are really quite low. And so, as you run down different categories of C&I or commercial real estate, or the various consumer categories, credit cards, the highest and first lien mortgage is the lowest, and there we have the biggest weight on mortgage and probably the lowest weight on card.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nOkay. And I presume in your Q and in your [Indecipherable], you'll be giving loan loss allowance by lending categories, so we can compare you to your peers by segment, right?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYup.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nAnd just one final one, do you have a sense or have you disclosed how much you've actually reserved or would you disclose or have a sense of how much you've actually reserved for oil and gas and entertainment and all of the higher risk sectors on I think Slide 28 to 30 just to get a sense of where you stand in terms of reserve levels in those categories?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWe haven't yet, because most of that is still a part of this qualitative top-up of the reserve, which is how the big builds for this quarter went down. This is all estimation and as a result, it's not specifically allocated by loan grade and by portfolio, it will get there. Those are the industries that I mentioned or the categories that I mentioned are the ones where we've leaned in the hardest, and on a qualitative basis, assumed certain levels of downgrade, which lead to the higher reserve factor being attached to them, but it hasn't run through the process yet that way because we haven't had those downgrades. So, we will start to provide more information. I'm not sure if it'll be in the Q, but certainly as the cycle unfolds and these things actually start to appear in the calculated graded reserve for C&I categories in particular.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nThanks a lot.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYup, thank you.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHi, John.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. Back to the through cycle loss number, your 2.75% [Phonetic] number. I know you just indicated that cards would be the highest in that assumption. Do you have what those through cycle numbers are that you have by bucket, for example, commercial real estate and card and C&I that make up the 2.75% [Phonetic]?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nRight. So the 2.75% is the CCAR severely adverse through the cycle cumulative loss level. So, it's not our through the cycle loss level. I know -- I'm not sure whether I wasn't clear. I don't want anybody to walk away thinking that that's what we anticipate experiencing through the average cycle. We have not laid all of that out. We -- I guess, I would look to the categories of loan loss disclosure with our last stress test. Those come from the Fed, they don't come from -- you get to see Wells Fargo's, but we haven't category-by-category laid it out. I can tell you that on the commercial side, it's about 2.5% and on the retail side, it's about 3%. But in terms of the individual components, we haven't run through that with folks.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOkay, got it. Got it. And then regarding the loan loss reserve from here, I believe, Charlie, you indicated in one of your previous answers that you could see incremental loan loss reserve built from here. Is that a fair assumption at this point given the -- given your expectation for the ongoing stress on borrowers, etc., that we could have incremental builds or do you think the -- we're on an adequate level given the recast of the back book and what you put on this current quarter in terms of where your reserve stands at this point?\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nYeah. I guess, let me just -- I'm not an economist. And so, I don't pretend to know any more about the future than any one else who's in my position. And I -- what I said was I think it's clear that economists are having a difficult time trying to figure out what the trajectory of unemployment and GDP will be. What I was saying was it just -- it wouldn't surprise me that people will continue to be surprised by the downside in the numbers. We've not seen anything in our own portfolios to suggest that we will be adding in the future. But if confidence does deteriorate and the shelter in place orders stay on for longer, which is possible, then it wouldn't surprise me that loss estimates would have to go up from this point. Again, I just -- it's not based on something that we've seen. We don't know the impact of all the programs that are out there, which we've never seen any things like seen anything like this before, but there is probably, I think it's fair to say, at least in my mind, there is more downside than there is upside at this point, just given the uncertainty of the environment today.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. That's helpful. If I can ask just one more, on the drawdown point, I know you had implied that you're seeing a little bit of stability there on the draws. Have drawdown from the commercial side trended as you had expected, or would you have thought that they could have exceeded the current level where they've showed some near-term leveling off?\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nYeah. So they came out of the gate fast and furious before borrowers actually experienced meaningful stress. So I would say that was a little faster than we probably would have imagined. In terms of how things have leveled off, the prior question about whether there was window dressing going on through the quarter-end where our borrowers wanted to have cash on their balance sheet, certainly possible that was a part of it. The high grade, well, the CP market being inaccessible for many users and the high-grade market being expensive or closed for a little bit certainly contributed to it too. Both of those things are functioning better now and these balances are still maintained. So it's not crystal clear whether that was a contributor to it, but it seemed a little fast.\nThe fact that it -- I think that folks are like Charlie mentioned with respect to our own results are trying to understand how long there to the -- if they're meaningfully affected from a sales perspective, how long shelter in place is going to change the nature of their business and they're going to make their liquidity determinations along the way. It feels like many people -- many business leaders made that determination relatively quickly in the early draws. But it's -- as I said, it's flattened out.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThe only thing I'd add is that -- this is not -- as we say over and over again, this isn't something that we've seen before. And so, did what we have thought that the number of industries and businesses would be shut down as quickly at the same time? No. Does that increase draw levels and the speed at which they draw? Absolutely. So -- but the fact that we're seeing some stability in those numbers and reductions in terms of where they are says an awful lot about the actions, certainly that the Fed has taken to stabilize the markets and give people the confidence that the markets will function well when they need to access them.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. All right. Thanks very much.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nHey, Matt.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. It seems like expenses in the first quarter came in a bit lower than expected even if we adjust for the deferred comp noise. Any outlook that you can provide on costs for the year?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nNot meaningful. We instituted a few programs for our employees in the first quarter that didn't cause much in the first quarter that will probably contribute a little extra throughout the course of the year. On the other hand, there is a range of revenue-related costs that will probably be lower with commissions, incentive comp types of things if that -- depending on business conditions of course and our ongoing level of performance. T&E is pretty much down to zero because people are not traveling or sheltering in place. We will have different technology cost that probably get a little bit more expensive as we've enabled 180,000 people who work from home that all has to get factored in. And then, of course, we've got certain types of expense that are levered to where the stock prices, etc. in this environment will probably be cheaper than it was a year ago, but not anything targeted or meaningful in this moment during the public health crisis beyond that.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nAnd the only thing that I would add is as we think about what the future is we were very clear on the last call about our views on our efficiency and the work we had to do. And given the environment that we're in, this is not the kind of environment where we're able to realize any meaningful savings. So we need to see light line of sight pass this crisis in order to continue to get back to the work that we have to do to drive that number down, which we still completely believe is they're doable and the right thing...\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nYou've made some comments in terms of the regulatory issues and obviously, the flexibility to help small business customers. But I need just kind of broader update on addressing regulatory issues, and there were some headlines that you were missing some deadlines in the media, which doesn't seem surprising since a lot of things are shut down, but anything you want to add from kind of a regulatory perspective that you're able to comment on.\nCharles W. Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer and President\nI'm not going to talk about anything specific. It's not the right thing to do. I'll just reiterate, we have a lot of work to do. I've been saying that very, very consistently. Our ability to get beyond some of these regulatory actions is based upon our doing the work properly. There is a bunch of it. We're continuing to devote all the necessary resources toward it even during this crisis. And that's really what I can say at this point.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOkay, understood. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. So, John, just wanted to ask a question about how you're managing the securities book. I recognize you guys call the NII guidance, but I'm just trying to understand given the significant declines at the long end of the curve. I was hoping you could help us frame where you are reinvesting today versus roughly 2.8% yield on the securities book. And maybe just bigger picture, what's your appetite to reinvest in other asset classes outside of agency MBS and treasuries to maybe mitigate some of those reinvestment pressures.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. It's a good question. So where we are investing today and I think we're -- we've got $6 billion to $9 billion a month of expected prepayment and maturity that needs to get redeployed. We have been and will likely continue to redeploy it into HQLA. There are certainly interesting opportunities in credit-sensitive securities, etc. They were really interesting in March, but they're still interesting today, but for low liquidity value, more risk-weighted types of investment, we're more likely to use our dry powder to -- for our customers, so for loan growth rather than on the securities front even though historically, we would have done both. And a portion of that is related to the existence of the asset cap. So it's still likely to be treasuries, Ginnies [Phonetic] and agency mortgages as we redeploy that $6 billion to $9 billion per month for the rest of the year.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nGot it. And just for my follow-up, I just wanted to try and gauge the near-term outlook for fee income. I know there's a lot of moving pieces this quarter. It looked like, if we adjust for all these specials, it was about a $1.3 billion drag suggesting maybe a core fee run rate somewhere around $7.7 billion. I'm just wondering as we look ahead, just given some of the pressures you cited on service charges, spend volume contracting, lower fees and wealth given the lagged quarter pricing. I guess, we'll have an offset from mortgage. I just wanted to try and frame how we should be thinking about the right jumping-off point for core fee income in 2Q and maybe just speak to your outlook for the remainder of the year.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo that's complicated for all the reasons we've been describing. I would say that you're right about the stepping off $0.4 million for Wealth and Investment Management, that will be lower. I expect mortgage to be stronger. We have a $60 billion pipeline and a stronger gain on sale on a per pound basis. So the second quarter should be good in that respect. The markets businesses are actually doing really well right now, although investment banking is quieter, high grade is open, but there isn't quite as much going on in non-investment grade or equity issuance. Card fees should be lower because transactional volumes are lower. Deposit service charges, my sense, will be lower because of actions that we're taking on a targeted basis to reverse fees where it's appropriate and it's -- it never works to add it all up and give a starting -- give a core number, but those are probably the bigger influences on fee income going into Q2.\nAnalyst\nThat's great, very helpful color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. You're welcome. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHello, Charles.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales -- Analyst\nHi. It's my guess that tail risk events are not over for this economic cycle. So, I was wondering if you could address two different tail risks as they relate to managing your interest rate sensitivity and the impact on your P&L. The first is, if we go into a multi-quarter period of negative rates, what are the actions you can take to manage that and how do you see that impacting your P&L? And then the second is, if bond vigilantes ever do come back and we got a steeping of the yield curve, 125 basis point spread between two's and ten's [Phonetic], what impact does that have on your P&L as it relates to NII, mortgage banking, and equity securities or debt securities?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. [Speech Overlap] the second one better than the first one.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales -- Analyst\nYeah, I know you would, but also, did you take any material actions in the month of March to hedge your interest rate risk going into the second quarter? So that -- those are the three separate questions, sorry.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So we'll go in reverse order. In the month of March, I would say getting longer duration, not much longer, but continuing to replace and add to duration in this investment portfolio is the most visible activity to defend against going lower in rates in any size. On the second question about what happens if we get a steepener, obviously, there is a hit to capital from OCI when that happens, because our bond portfolio loses value, but with the amount that we have regularly to reinvest with deposits at levels that they are, etc., we are sensitive to the, call, at that seven-year to 10-year point and without putting a specific number on it, it's probably the -- it's among the biggest drivers in terms of the way we're positioned for increasing net interest income and the reverse is true as well.\nAnd then with respect to negative rates, there is a handful of things. I mean, it's obviously looking at Europe or looking at Japan, there is plenty of examples of why that's not a terrific environment to be in for banking, but on the LIBOR-based lending side, I'd make the point that I think substantially all of our C&I loans that are LIBOR-based have floors in them so that we're not worried about eating through margin, still an attractive place to be, but we've protected ourselves in that way. I think there are a range of deposit-related activities that we have where we would begin to institute charging for holding cash. Given our -- the existence of the asset cap, we can't overpay for deposits because we were in the business of sending low liquidity value deposits back to bank customers and the like. So, we would probably pretty quick to be managing what we pay for deposits to -- so that we didn't have an incremental influx that we didn't have an appetite for.\nAnd then as I mentioned, adding or maintaining a sort of fixed rate posture, duration -- long duration posture on the investment portfolio is a way to abate earning a negative rate as rates go below zero. I don't you're suggesting there's a higher probability of that. I think Fed's been pretty clear. There have been some instances where bills went negative just because of technical factors, but I don't think it's at least currently part of the playbook for the Fed, and in the other jurisdictions around the world, where it has occurred out the curve, it started with a policy decision to do it at the front end. So, I like the steeper curve better than the -- better than negative rates among your questions.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nHi, Brian.\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. Just a quick question on first maybe the mortgage banking and can you kind of walk through the decision to exit on the non-conforming correspondent? I mean, I heard that expecting loss rates below in residential mortgage. Was this an issue with the asset cap or just credit risk, more broadly?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIt's really shelf space and putting our own retail customers at the front line as one of the leverage that we're using to manage living under the asset cap, not credit risk in particular.\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nOkay. And then a separate question, I think with a lot of kind of one-off items in the quarter that were due just where markets were at the end of the quarter or where spreads were? I know there was the reserve for debt securities, equity impairments, and then also hedge ineffectiveness. Are any of those expected to reverse, given where markets are at this point in time or where rates are for the hedging activity?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nOn hedge ineffectiveness, I wouldn't expect that to reverse or to persist sort of a confluence of events that gave rise to it for the quarter. So that probably goes back to net expectation of call it a net zero expectation and it can drift up or down depending on what happens in the LIBOR OIS basis or for some other reasons. In terms of equity impairments, those [Indecipherable], and there are some measurement alternative activities that actually do get written back up when the situation warrants it, but I wouldn't expect that to happen in the early stages of a recession if that's where we are in the next few quarters. Obviously, there are lots of ways to earn that back over the life of those investments, but it will take a while for that to reveal itself. And what was the last one? There were couple of different examples.\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nThe reserve for debt securities.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I don't anticipate that it will. Those are -- that relates to both AFS and held for -- held to maturity securities. So presumably, there were some AFS securities that might get sold or mature that release some of that, but I don't think it just comes right back. That is the nature of OTTI.\nBrian Kleinhanzl -- KBW -- Analyst\nAll right, thanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Securities -- Analyst\nHi, thanks for taking my questions, Charlie and John. A couple of things, firstly, how the total criticized do the quarter? I know you mentioned oil and gas. Have we seen any -- firstly any numbers and have you seen any impact of any of those other industries where this concern? And in -- as you look at your commercial loan book, you broke down the drawdowns into CIB, commercial banking, commercial capital, and CRE. Any color on the outstandings in those and also the breakdown of how criticized it in those four categories?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nSo criticized loan balances increased about $4 billion in the quarter, almost all of it in March. Trying to do the math here, a big piece of it for those that are in the industries that we mentioned earlier, airlines, for example, you'll see it, you'll see it and energy, for sure. There have been -- there is some commercial real estate that has already come through. It's just -- it's so early because this all occurred in size in the -- in mid- to late-March that we'll probably see more of that realizing itself in Q2, which is part of why our allowance build is really so much from a qualitative perspective. I mean, it's based in math, but it's not driven by loan ratings, etc., which drive the quantitative approach.\nSo, I think you'll see it coming from the usual places. We'll have more specifics in the 10-Q when we file it, and then, of course, you'll see the behavior in actual -- we'll receive financials, we'll administer loans on a loan-by-loan basis through the second quarter and that will update the quantitative model and the disclosures in Q2.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Securities -- Analyst\nAnd how do you -- how does your commercial loan book breakdown between CIB, Commercial Banking, Commercial Capital, really those are your three biggest categories. And I guess there's a little bit of CRE included in the C&I, any color on that?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nThere will be when we publish those segments. What we have in the deck today that shows total C&I outstandings and commitments is a superset of those businesses. So you can see the total that where we draw the lines between what is in which segment. We haven't added up and disclosed it that way, but you will begin to see that way in Q2.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Securities -- Analyst\nOkay. Another question, you mentioned on the page on deposits that you grew deposits in consumer through high-yield savings. Given any color on why you are growing high-yield savings, you're really not trying -- I didn't think you were trying to grow deposits, any color on what what's behind that?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Well, high yield doesn't -- isn't the same today as it was a year ago. Some of where we grow is that -- is the preference of the customer choosing where they're going to put their money in this -- the label of high-yield savings means something different. As I said a little bit earlier, we are forecasting our deposit cost to come down substantially throughout the remainder of 2020 reflecting what you're suggesting, which is in a flight-to-quality time frame with the liquidity preference by our customers. The deposits are rolling through the door, and we are not overpaying for them. You will see in Q2, I think, substantially all of the incentives from last year as we are building deposits at a slightly more expensive time frame to finally roll off. And then -- so through Q2, Q3 and Q4 as we currently forecasted, we're going to be getting back to deposit costs of the, call it, 2014, 2015 era.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Securities -- Analyst\nGreat, thank you.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah.\nOperator\nAnd ladies and gentlemen, we do have time for one more question and that last question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, gentlemen. John, can you share with us on the Slide 15, you gave us the total outstandings and the total commitments, I think it's about 58% outstandings to commitments. What was that number at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019? And within those categories you gave us, who had the biggest drawdowns?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nWell, that's a very specific question you're asking me.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nJust save the worst for last.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, yeah, yeah. Well, so, I don't have that information right in front of me. I can tell you that as a category and this was on Slide 12 in the same deck. Our utilization rate jumped up almost 90% [Phonetic] to 49%. So for the whole universe of wholesale commitments, we have been in the high 30s and now, we're in the high 40s of utilization. I'm going to have our IR folks follow up with you, because we do -- we have been tracking utilization or I should say draw request by industry and that might be useful, but I don't have it right in front of me.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nNo, that's good. Thank you. And someone else complemented you guys the breakout on the portfolios for oil and gas, retail, transportation, entertainment was very helpful. If you could provide then suggestion from the next time for the financial, except banks, I think that would be helpful. One last question for you. It's a technical question. If your assumptions in CECL are correct on the economy that you guys used to build up the CECL reserve this quarter. If they're correct, in the second quarter, do we see the provision being primarily then to cover net charge-offs and loan growth and no more CECL reserve buildup, is that correct, is that the way we should look at it?\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nIn theory, if you had perfect foresight, but you also have to kind of know RWA growth in the same time frame because at a minimum, you'd be capturing allowance for the change in the loan portfolio from one quarter to the next. So -- but I would discourage anyone from imagining that at this point in time that any bank has got perfect clairvoyance about what the future holds and whether it gets better or gets worse, I'm sure it will be a little bit different.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nNo doubt. I appreciate that. Thank you for the candor.\nJohn R. Shrewsberry -- Senior Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Terrific, terrific. Well, thank you everybody. That was our last call. And this is the first step on a journey as we go into this cycle. We've been saying for some time that we're late in the cycle. We're going to stop saying that because now we're early in the cycle. And we'll be working with each of you to help understand your -- answer your questions where we can and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much.\nCharles W.

{"date": "Oct 14, 2020, 10:00 a.m. ET", "exchange": "NYSE: WFC", "q": "2020-Q3", "ticker": "WFC", "transcript": "Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nGood morning. My name is Regina, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Wells Fargo third-quarter earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director of Investor Relations\nThank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, John Shrewsberry, will discuss third-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded.\nBefore we get started, I would like to remind you that our third-quarter earnings release and quarterly supplement are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings release and quarterly supplements. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings, in the earnings release, and the quarterly supplement available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie Scharf.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'll make some brief comments about our third-quarter results, provide some commentary on the operating environment and our direction. I'll then turn the call over to John to review third-quarter results in more detail. Let me start by acknowledging that this will be the last earnings call with John, who announced his retirement in July.\nJohn has served as an excellent financial and strategic leader for our company and has been incredibly helpful to me in my first year at Wells. John, thank you very much for all you've done. You will be missed. As you know, Mike Santomassimo will be joining Wells Fargo this week as CFO.\nMike has more than 20 years of leadership experience in banking and finance and most recently served as the CFO of BNY Mellon. And I'm looking forward to Mike hitting the ground running. I'm going to start by making some comments on the markets, economy, and operating environment that impacted us this quarter. Most market and liquidity trends are strong and continue to improve in the quarter.\nDespite modest credit spread widening that followed volatility in the equity markets, market spreads have continued their steady improvement since the peak of dislocation and remain significantly tighter than the levels observed in March. Corporate new issuance volume remains elevated. HQLA bid/ask, a measure of the cost to transfer risk, and daily volatility have improved and are now below pre-crisis levels. And the Fed's pledge of unlimited support has improved risk appetite, tightened spreads, and deepened market liquidity.\nThe economy has materially improved due to the gradual reopening but also the significant monetary and fiscal stimulus, as well as the significant accommodations made by financial institutions and other businesses. Labor markets clearly reflect momentum with the third-quarter average jobless rate improving to 8.8% after posting a 13% rate during the second quarter. However, there's still a long way to go, and there remains significant risk to the recovery. The pace of job growth and the rebound in consumer spending have slowed, and the diminished pace of reopening and the end of some stimulus programs are presenting headwinds.\nThe powerful rebound in the third quarter still leaves the economy well below its pre-COVID peak, including restaurant sales 15% lower; real GDP 4% lower, and unemployment 7% below pre-COVID levels. Clearly, the recovery is in process. And while the gains we've seen this quarter are important, the path to full recovery for all remains uncertain. Let me now turn to our performance this quarter.\nWe reported net income after tax of $2 billion or $0.42 a share. Revenues benefited from very strong mortgage banking. And most other fee-related items also improved over the prior quarter, with the exception of trading, which while down from the exceptionally strong second quarter, still produced strong results. NII declined, reflecting the impact of the lower interest rate environment and lower loan balances, primarily driven by weaker aggregate demand across our commercial client base.\nExpenses were elevated and impacted by two significant items: $961 million in customer accruals and a $718 million restructuring charge. Charge-offs declined from the second quarter, and our allowance was largely unchanged. Credit performance across almost all loan products was stronger than we would have anticipated a quarter ago. However, it's certainly too early to draw conclusions yet.\nThe actions from the Fed, our government, and financial institutions I referred to earlier have clearly helped consumers and companies of all sizes. But much of this is ending, and until the risks of COVID are behind us, these individuals and companies are still at risk without more support. Having said that, the fact that we are in a better place than expected is a good thing, and that shouldn't be lost. Our top priority continues to be the implementation of our risk control and regulatory work, though we're also taking targeted actions to improve the experience for our customers, clients, communities, and employees.\nI will discuss this later. We continue to add talent to the senior management team and key roles to strengthen the foundation of the company. In addition to Mike joining as CFO, Ather Williams is joining Wells Fargo this month to lead our strategy, digital, and innovations group and will report to me. He will lead corporate strategic planning; define and manage digital platform standards and capabilities; and manage innovation priorities, opportunities, and companywide efforts to drive transformation.\nWe added other senior leaders, including a new head of Home Lending, and several key risk leaders as part of our enhanced risk model to further strengthen the independent oversight of all risk-taking activities and provide a more comprehensive view of risk across the company. In August, we announced that Mark Chancy was elected to the company's board of directors. Mark has more than 30 years of banking and financial services experience with an impressive combination of business, operational, and finance experience. He serves on the board's Audit Committee and Risk Committee.\nIn the third quarter, we also launched Clear Access Banking, a new low-cost, convenient bank account with no overdraft fees. Clear Access is off to a strong start with over 100,000 accounts signed up so far and is proving very popular with people under 25, a big part of its intended target population. This is part of our broader efforts to simplify our products and services and create clear, easy to use, and better experiences for our customers. As part of our simplification efforts, we will be reducing the number of different consumer checking accounts we offer, making it easier for both our customers and our bankers while also reducing expenses associated with supporting legacy products.\nWe continue to have over 200,000 employees working from home, and we don't anticipate this changing until at least December. Just under 20% of our branches remain temporarily closed, but we've opened more of our branch lobbies to enable our customers to come in and have conversations with our bankers instead of just using our drive-thru for transactions. And our teller and ATM transactions increased 8% from the second quarter. Wells Fargo was recently recognized as leading the U.S.\nfinancial services industry in COVID-19 safety according to a nationwide study. This is great recognition for the work of all those at Wells who've worked tirelessly to keep our employees and customers as safe as possible. We've continued to make significant accommodations for our customers. Since March, we've helped more than 3.2 million consumers and small business customers by deferring payments and waiving fees.\nThe trailing seven-day average of new daily payment deferrals granted as of September 30 has declined 97% from their peak in early April. Debit card spend has remained strong since returning to pre-COVID levels in May, and in the last week of September, was up approximately 10% from the same week a year ago. Consumer credit spend improved throughout the third quarter but still is down approximately 4% in the last week of September compared to a year ago, an improvement from the beginning -- an improvement from being down approximately 10% from a year ago as of the end of June. This reflects steady improvement across a variety of categories.\nBut despite a rebound, hard-hit segments, like travel, entertainment, and fuel, remain significantly lower year on year. Commercial card spend remains significantly lower throughout the quarter and was still down approximately 30% in the last full week of September compared to the same week a year ago. Digital usage trends continue to be strong. As an example, mobile deposit dollar volume was a record high in the third quarter and was up 110% compared to a year ago.\nLet me take a moment to expand on the conversation I started last quarter on expenses. We believe that our franchise is capable of earning far more than we're earning today. We continue to believe there's nothing structural in our business to stop us from having a competitive efficiency ratio, though we are far from it today. Prior to 2016, Wells Fargo had an efficiency ratio that was far more competitive with our peers.\nAs you know, we've had to make significant investments in people and technology to address prior underinvestment in risk and controls, and also have had outsized litigation and customer remediation expenses. This accounts for part of our elevated expense base. We also believe that we have significant opportunity to take targeted actions that are focused on improving the experience for our customers, clients, communities, and employees. These actions should also improve operational and financial performance.\nWe have also lagged behind our competitors in revenue performance, and we also believe we've got significant opportunities to make substantial improvements here as well. To be clear, our focus starts with running the company more effectively and efficiently. This includes reducing bureaucracy, simplifying our products, processes and our organization, reducing redundancy and manual work, and migrating customers and employees to digital solutions. All of this will also improve our control environment.\nLower expenses will be a byproduct of doing these things. We're taking an organized and structured approach to reviewing this across the entire company. We've established dedicated teams in each of our lines of businesses and functions. We're reviewing near-term, medium-term, and long-term actions.\nWe're already working on the near-term actions, including streamlining management ranks through spans and layers and other business improvements. Again, these are driven at making it easier for us to serve our customers and each other. These actions were the primary driver of the $718 million restructuring charge we took this quarter. These actions should reduce gross run-rate expenses by over $1 billion annually.\nWe also identified many medium- and longer-term actions that will take some time to fully implement. These include simplifying products in many of our businesses, optimizing operational and client service delivery, and continuing to downsize our corporate real estate portfolio. I understand that many of you would like more specifics on our plans. The reviews we're conducting across the entire company continue and we are in the midst of the 2021 planning cycle.\nWe need to be thorough in our work, and it's important that we understand three pieces before providing specifics to you: the magnitude and timing of the initiatives I've just discussed; where we think we need to invest to drive improved operational and financial performance; and most importantly, understanding the investments necessary to complete the buildout of our risk and control infrastructure, which will ultimately satisfy our regulatory commitments. I cannot stress the importance of this work enough. We cannot and will not do anything to jeopardize this work. It is also important that Mike have a chance to review our plans, which he will do immediately.\nAll that said, we should be in a position to provide more specificity regarding 2021 expense expectations on our call next quarter. While there is much work to do, and it will take time, our ultimate goal is to build a best-in-class business and hope to show progress along the way. This includes both competitive level of expenses and competitive revenue performance. Finally, I want to thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and dedication to making Wells Fargo better.\nI will now turn the call over to John.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. We earned $2 billion in the third quarter, up $4.4 billion from the second quarter, driven by lower provision expense. We grew revenue, but our expenses remain too high. I'll be describing the drivers of our results in more detail throughout the call.\nSo let me just summarize a few items that impacted our third-quarter results that we included on Page 2. As Charlie highlighted, we had a $718 million restructuring charge, predominantly driven by severance expense, which drove the increase in noninterest expense in the third quarter and is expected to reduce our gross run-rate expenses by over $1 billion annually. We had $961 million of customer remediation accruals for a variety of matters. The increase of this accrual related mostly to previously disclosed matters and reflected an expansion of the customer population, the time period and/or the amount of reimbursement as part of our ongoing analysis of doing the right thing for our customers while resolving outstanding matters as quickly as possible.\nWe also had $452 million of noninterest income related to a change in the accounting measurement model for nonmarketable equity securities from our affiliated venture capital partnership. As you know, we typically have gains or losses from equity securities driven by market valuations, which we had again in the third quarter. Our effective income tax rate for the third quarter was near our expectations, and we currently expect our effective income tax rate for the fourth quarter to be less than 10%, primarily as a result of expected tax credits. Turning to Page 3.\nOur capital and liquidity continued to be strong, with our CET1 level $28.3 billion above the regulatory minimum and our LCR 34 percentage points above our regulatory minimum. At the end of the third quarter, our primary unencumbered sources of liquidity totaled approximately $494 billion. Turning to loans on Page 4. Both average and period-end loans declined from the second quarter, with growth in consumer loans more than offset by declines in commercial loans.\nI'll explain the drivers of commercial and consumer period-end loan balances in more detail starting with commercial loans on Page 5. C&I loans declined $29.2 billion or 8% from the second quarter, driven by higher paydowns, reflecting continued liquidity and strength in the capital markets and lower loan demand, including revolving line utilization, declining to pre-COVID utilization levels, particularly in our middle market business. Commercial real estate loans decreased $1.2 billion from the second quarter, reflecting weaker demand in commercial real estate mortgage, which was partially offset by growth in commercial real estate construction in categories that have not been negatively impacted by the pandemic. This includes multifamily projects and industrial facilities, including data centers.\nConsumer loans increased $15.8 billion from the second quarter. This increase was driven by the repurchase of $21.9 billion of first mortgage loans from Ginnie Mae securitization pools. We had a high level of these early pool buyouts in the quarter due to COVID-related payment deferrals. We also reclassified $9 billion of first mortgage loans from held for sale to held for investment.\nCredit card loans were relatively stable from the second quarter as consumer spending increased after declining over $2 billion for two consecutive quarters. However, balances were down $3.6 billion from a year ago, reflecting the economic slowdown associated with COVID-19. Auto loans declined $358 million from the second quarter, and originations declined 5%. We continue to take certain actions to mitigate future loss exposure while our spreads on new originations continued to improve.\nOther revolving credit and installment loans increased $812 million from the second quarter as higher security-based lending was partially offset by lower personal loans and lines and lower student loans. During the third quarter, we notified our customers of our exit from the student loan business as part of our ongoing process of pruning certain businesses as we assess our strategic priorities. Turning to deposits on Page 7. We continue to have lower deposit growth than the industry due to actions we've taken to manage under the asset cap.\nHowever, even after these actions, average deposits grew $107.6 billion or 8% from a year ago and were up $12.3 billion from the second quarter. The linked-quarter growth was driven by noninterest-bearing deposits which were up 8%, while interest-bearing deposits declined 2%. Period-end deposits increased $74.7 billion from a year ago but declined $27.5 billion from the second quarter. This decline was driven by actions we've taken to reduce nonoperational Wholesale Banking deposits, as well as pricing and other actions in our consumer businesses.\nConsumer and small business banking deposits grew $9.9 billion from the second quarter, reflecting continued COVID-related impacts, including customers' preferences for liquidity, loan payment deferrals, and stimulus checks. Average deposit cost declined to 9 basis points, down 62 basis points from a year ago and 8 basis points from the second quarter. Net interest income declined $512 million or 5% from the second quarter primarily due to the low-interest rate environment which resulted in balance sheet repricing as earning asset yields continued to decline faster than funding liabilities; balance sheet mix shifts into lower-yielding assets, including the impact of lower commercial loan demand which resulted in higher cash balances; and $120 million of higher MBS premium amortization due to higher prepayment rates. These declines were partially offset by higher variable sources of income and one additional day in the quarter.\nThe first nine months of 2020, our net interest income was $30.6 billion. With the completion of the third quarter, we now expect full-year 2020 net interest income to be approximately $40 billion, which is lower than our previous guidance due to lower commercial loan balances and higher MBS premium amortization. Turning to Page 9. Noninterest income increased $1.5 billion or 19% from the second quarter, with growth in many fee-related businesses.\nWhile we've continued to waive certain fees for customers impacted by the pandemic, deposit-related fees were up $157 million from the second quarter, driven by higher customer transaction volume. Trust and investment fees increased $163 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by higher retail brokerage advisory fees, partially offset by lower Investment Banking fees with fee accounts down from record second-quarter levels. Card fees increased $115 million from the second quarter, with debit card transaction volume up 12% and credit card purchase volume up 22%. Mortgage banking fees increased $1.3 billion from the second quarter.\nThe 2020 mortgage origination market should be the largest on record, and capacity constraints continue to increase margins. Total residential held for sale mortgage originations increased 12% from the second quarter to $48 billion, and our production margin increased to 216 basis points, up 12 basis points from the second quarter and up 95 basis points from a year ago. We currently expect fourth-quarter origination volume to be similar to third-quarter levels despite typical seasonal declines. And fourth-quarter production margins should remain strong.\nMortgage servicing income increased $1 billion from the second quarter due to $296 million of favorable net MSR hedging results in the third quarter and a negative valuation adjustment in our MSR model as a result of higher prepayment assumptions and higher expected servicing costs in the second quarter that did not repeat. Net gains from trading activities declined $446 million from a record second quarter primarily due to lower fixed-income trading results, partially offset by higher equity trading results. Turning to expenses on Page 10. Our expenses increased to $678 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by the $718 million restructuring charge that I highlighted earlier on the call.\nCharlie highlighted in his comments the details we have on Slide 11 on the progress we're making to reduce expenses and build a stronger Wells Fargo. Many ideas have been generated with the fresh perspective from leaders throughout the organization. This renewed focus is critical to our future success, not only improving our efficiency ratio but also enabling us to become more streamlined and agile and better serve our customers while we continue to invest in our business and meet our regulatory commitments. Turning to our business segments, starting on Page 12.\nWe continue to make refinements to the composition of our operating segments and allocation methodologies. Additionally, we're still in the process of transitioning key leadership positions, including Mike Santomassimo, who will be joining Wells Fargo later this week. We now expect to update our operating segment disclosures, including comparative financial results, in the fourth-quarter 2020 and provide full-year 2020 results under the new reporting structure. On Page 13, we provide our Community Banking metrics.\nWe had 32 million digital active customers, up 6% from a year ago and 3% from the second quarter. Digital logins declined from record second-quarter levels but were up 11% from a year ago. And the number of checks deposited using a mobile device reached another record high in the third quarter and increased 36% from a year ago. With approximately 18% of our branches temporarily closed due to COVID-19 and more customers using our digital channels, our teller and ATM transactions declined 22% from a year ago but increased 8% from the second quarter as the economy began to reopen and we reopened more of our branches.\nTurning to Page 14. Wholesale Banking reported net income of $1.5 billion, up $3.6 billion from the second quarter, driven by lower provision for credit losses. Revenue declined $969 million from the second quarter, reflecting lower net gains from trading activities and Investment Banking fees, both of which were at record levels in the second quarter. Net interest income declined from the second quarter primarily due to lower loan and deposit balances and lower fixed-income trading assets.\nAverage loan balances declined 5% from the second quarter. Revolving loan utilization in September of 36% declined 280 basis points from June. And unfunded lending commitments increased 2% from the prior quarter. Wealth and Investment Management earned $463 million in the third quarter, up $283 million from the second quarter, primarily driven by lower provision for credit losses and higher asset-based fees benefiting from improved market performance.\nThe decline in earnings from a year ago was driven by the $1.1 billion gain on the sale of our institutional retirement and trust business in the third quarter of 2019. WIM average deposits increased $4 billion from the second quarter and were up $33 billion or 23% from a year ago, driven by higher cash allocation in brokerage client accounts. WIM deposit costs in the third quarter were in the single digits and have declined over 50 basis points from a year ago. Turning to credit results on Page 16.\nOur net charge-off rate declined 17 basis points from the second quarter to 29 basis points, which was better than we anticipated a quarter ago given the challenging economic environment. Losses improved across our commercial and consumer portfolios. However, customer accommodations we provided since the start of the pandemic could delay the recognition of net charge-offs, delinquencies, and nonaccrual status. So it's too early to draw any conclusions about future losses based on credit performance in the third quarter.\nCommercial criticized assets declined 2% from the second quarter with broad-based declines in C&I, partially offset by an increase in commercial real estate loans. Nonaccrual loans increased $417 million from the second quarter, driven by higher consumer real estate, auto, and commercial real estate nonaccruals. On Page 17, we provide more detail on our C&I and lease financing portfolio by industry, including the declines in loans outstanding and total commitments from the second quarter. C&I and lease financing nonaccruals were stable from the second quarter as declines in oil and gas and retail were largely offset by increases in other industries, including healthcare and pharmaceutical and transportation services.\nOf note, 39% of nonaccruals were in oil and gas, down from 47% in the second quarter. Turning to our commercial real estate portfolio on Page 18. Commercial real estate nonaccruals increased $126 million from the second quarter, with declines in hotel, motel, and agriculture, more than offset by increases in other categories with the largest increase in office buildings. Criticized assets were up $2.3 billion or 22% from the second quarter, with 92% of the increase driven by hotel, motel, shopping center, and retail sectors.\nThe percentage of our consumer loan portfolio that remained in a COVID-related payment deferral as of the end of the third quarter declined. As we show on Page 19, we had declines across our consumer portfolios. These calculations exclude first mortgage loans that are guaranteed or insured by the government, which we believe have minimal credit risk. On Page 20, we provide detail on our allowance for credit losses for loans.\nOur allowance coverage for total loans was 2.22% in the third quarter with stability across most loan classes and an increase for credit card loans. Our allowance of $20.5 billion was stable from the second quarter, reflecting an improving economic environment and solid credit performance in the third quarter but with continued uncertainty due to COVID-19. In determining our allowance, we considered current economic conditions, which improved compared with prior expectations as unemployment levels decreased during the third quarter. We also considered that recent credit performance reflected the support of fiscal stimulus, lender accommodations, and borrowers' ability to access liquidity.\nThese factors drove lower loss expectations in our quantitative models. However, there is increased uncertainty in economic forecasts that vary widely, and future credit performance may deteriorate as stimulus effects that benefited recent credit performance come to an end. We increased our qualitative reserves, reflecting a variety of factors, including our exposure to significantly impacted industries, the limited transaction activity, and wide variability of market valuations for property types in our commercial real estate portfolio and the elevated default risk for borrowers as payment-deferral programs end. While the timing of the end of the pandemic and the eventual path to an economic recovery remain uncertain, we believe that our allowance captures the expected loss content in our portfolio as of the end of the quarter.\nTurning to Page 21. As I highlighted earlier, our CET1 ratio remained well above our regulatory minimum, increasing to 11.4% in the third quarter. As you can see, our standardized and advanced approach ratios are now in very close proximity. We currently expect that internal loan portfolio credit ratings, which were also contemplated in the development of our allowance, will result in higher risk-weighted assets under the advanced approach and under the standardized approach in the coming quarters, which would reduce our CET1 ratio and other RWA-based capital ratios.\nThat said, we expect to maintain strong capital ratios that exceed both regulatory requirements and internal targets after considering this expected trend in risk-weighted assets. In summary, while our results in the third quarter improved from the second quarter, they were still down significantly from a year ago, reflecting the impact of the economic downturn. Even though we can't predict the path to a full economic recovery, we're focused on improving business performance by reducing our expenses while meeting our regulatory commitments and appropriately investing in our business. And we'll now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi, good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHi, Betsy. Good morning.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nA couple of questions. One is on the $1 billion improvement in expenses that you outlined earlier in your prepared remarks. I realize that you're talking about a lot of investments that you need to make as well. But I'm just wondering, is this $1 billion expected to come through in net expense reductions as we look out over the next year?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Betsy, it's Charlie. Thanks for the question. I would say, like I referred in the remarks, it's gross reduction. It's real.\nIt will be there. We'll see it next year. But we're still continuing to go through our plan for next year, and we're looking at all of the investments that are necessary, both on the control side, as well as the investment side. And so it's too early to be definitive about what the net numbers look like at this point, but as I said last quarter, we want to show progress.\nAnd progress is a combination of taking actions on the gross side but also showing you something on the net side. But I think the right thing at this point is to give you a much clearer guidance on next quarter's call after we finish our budget work and after Mike gets to review the work himself.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. Yeah. OK. I get that.\nAnd then just separately, Charlie, you were mentioning how there's opportunities to get more efficient. There's also opportunities to get, I don't know, your share of the revenue. I know it's early, but could you give us a sense as to what you're thinking about when you highlight that? Where do you see opportunities for Wells on the revenue side?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. I mean, I would say when we look at our business, kind of put the trajectory of NII to the side for a second because of the low rate environment, just talking about building franchise and the opportunities that present itself. I think when you look at -- let's go business by business quickly. When you look at our consumer and small business banking franchise, we've been on the defensive now for a very long time, appropriately so given the issues and problems that we had.\nA tremendous amount of work has been done by all the folks leading those businesses. Our franchise is still extraordinarily strong. And you see it, by the way, even in just the deposit growth that we've had in that segment, which says an awful lot about what our customers think of us. But while we had been investing in some of the digital capabilities, which you do see the marketplace tremendous opportunities to grow with the affluent customer base.\nAt the other end, we've rolled out a product for those that are far less affluent, which is very competitive and getting real traction. And so I think in the consumer and small business space, the opportunities are significant. In the consumer lending space, the mortgage business, the demand is greater than our ability to process at this point still, and that's still where we sit today. We have opportunities in the card space to leverage the customer base that we have, staying within our risk framework the way we've defined it, but just doing a better job at delivering card and other payments products.\nThe commercial bank, I think, is an extraordinary franchise. And both things that we do on a stand-alone basis there, as well as things we do in partnership with products we have in the corporate investment bank, are still huge opportunities for us. In our Wealth and Investment Management space, the wealth business, we're one of the few that have this sizable franchise in a space that we love. We've made progress at having the business work together across our private bank and across our brokerage business.\nBut we're just getting started there. And I think the opportunities, even with the very strong performance we've had this quarter, are still extremely strong. And then lastly, in the corporate investment banking space, again, I would have said as an outsider that Wells had been very, very smart at building the business where it has traditional strength in serving customers, and that's the path that we'll continue to be on. So when I look at all these businesses, I feel very good about our ability to grow the franchise.\nAnd it's a question now of timing and prioritization.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. Anything in particular you'd think about maybe saving to make room for growth given the asset cap is kind of getting in the way of growth on the balance sheet, at least?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. I mean, I think -- so I mean, we're very actively looking at not below those five businesses that I just described. We're very actively looking at all of the portfolios and all the businesses below that. And we're going to continue to exit some things which aren't core to the U.S.\nbanking franchise that we are, not that it's U.S. only but supporting the core customer base that we have. And so I would expect, over the next couple of quarters, we will create some room on the balance sheet by exiting some things that aren't core.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. Super. Thanks. Thanks, Charlie.\nAppreciate it.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI do want to just -- but I just want to be clear. We're exiting them because they aren't core to serving our core customer base on the consumer and large corporate side. We're not exiting them because of the asset cap. I think that will help.\nOperator\nOur next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.\nMatt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. That was a really good kind of overview of how you're thinking about the businesses just from a big-picture perspective. I think a lot of investors are looking for kind of this big rollout of the strategy that put some numbers and more meat behind kind of what you just said. And obviously, COVID is delaying that, I would assume.\nObviously, you're really focused on the regulatory issues. But is that something that you do plan to do? And is the timing of kind of getting out of the asset cap, driving something like that, say, like a virtual investor day or something similar?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. Well, I think you said it very well, Matt. I appreciate what you said, which is that there's no doubt that in terms of the way we'd be thinking about the trajectory of the business and what the opportunities for us over the shorter and early medium term are different today that we're in this COVID environment than not. And so it's kind of hard to have a meaningful conversation that looks well beyond that when we're far from through this.\nAnd so we are very focused on the things that we need to do in this environment to improve our performance, albeit with an eye toward making sure that we're building the company for the long term. The regulatory work, as you mentioned, again, I said it in my remarks. I can't stress it enough. It's a gating factor for us to be able to take advantage of all the opportunities that we have in the franchise.\nWe're putting a tremendous amount of time and attention and effort toward this. And understanding exactly what those resources look like and how that impacts the company is the work that we continue to go through. And as I said, by the time we get to the end of next quarter, we'll give you a clear look as to what we think that means for 2021. And then listen.\nThe asset cap, I wish there was more to say about it. But we're focused on controlling what we can control, which is doing the work that's been asked of us, which is totally appropriate. We're in the process of doing that. And there's no doubt that while the asset cap exists, that we do have a limitation that others don't have.\nOthers have other limitations with different ratios and whatnot. That is one that we have. And so it is fair to say we will not be able to extract the full potential out of the franchise until after the asset cap has gone. Doesn't mean that we don't have the opportunities to grow from where we are today, and we can talk a little bit about that if you want.\nBut that certainly does factor into our thinking about what the trajectory of the company looks like and the time frames.\nMatt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nAnd then just to be clear, in terms of kind of presenting kind of this, call it, while the asset cap is still there and kind of the post asset cap view, is that something that you're going to come out to investors and put some targets out there? And again, some more meat behind the strategic update, or we'll get the expense outlook in '21 in a little bit more kind of piecemeal as you think about giving guidance and strategic outlook?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI would expect that you'd get a -- that we'd be giving you not just an expense outlook but an update on how we're thinking about the different businesses and when we talk about the things that belong and don't belong, how that fits. And then we're also going to be giving you, at the end of the quarter when we report, not just the quarter but the full-year results based upon the segment looks, which will make pretty clear where we stand versus our competition. And we'll be able to talk through what those differences are and how we think about that.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nThey also reflect some strategic decisions that have already been made and will allow you to look at the businesses on a heads-up basis versus competitors, the way the current leaders are intending to run them going forward. So there's a lot of information in that.\nMatt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nAnd then just lastly if I could squeeze in on the asset cap. I think February is going to be three years, which investors ask me, like, how long I think it's going to linger. And I'm like, I don't really know, but there's four CEOs, three chairs, three years. There's obviously been like a lot of change, a lot of effort.\nAnd I know there's only so much that you can share and maybe there's only so much that you know. But like, what should we be looking for from the outside? Because cumulatively, it does seem like there's been a lot of effort. And hopefully, it's accelerated the past year. But it seems like there's been a lot of important milestones, at least from an external point of view.\nSo what can we look for if anything?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nListen. I mean, what you can look at is you can look at the people that we have in roles today that have dealt with these issues before. And the organization today does, in fact, look very different than it was a year ago or even six or nine months ago. And as I've said, when you look at the Fed consent order, it's pretty straightforward in terms of what they're asking for.\nThe environment that they're asking for is the same thing that they've asked all the other big banks for. So getting the experience inside the company that actually understands exactly what is required of us, I think, is extraordinarily important. And that team is actively working through what's got to be delivered. Again, I wish I could say more, Matt.\nAs I said, it's ultimately the regulators on all of our issues are going to be the ones to determine when it's done to their satisfaction. But again, I could tell you, there's no question in my mind that we have a first-class team in place now working on it that's experienced, many that have dealt with these issues before. It has this sense of urgency in the company, which I think is different than what we had in the past. The amount of time and resources that the senior team is spending on this is extraordinary.\nYou'd be shocked at the amount of time because we know we need to do what's required. And beyond that, again, I can't speak for the regulators. So that's what I'd say.\nMatt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks for taking my questions.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHey, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Ken.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nJohn, just on your NII point, understanding that we're still kind of seeing this decline in loans and the premium am, does the fourth quarter get to a stabilization point with NII as you look out into next year? And what would be the drivers to kind of put that bottom in as you think about the mix of earning assets and what you expect with deposit growth? Thanks.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. So the pieces of it are deposit pricing on the one hand, and that's come down meaningfully, has a little bit more to go but will likely bottom out in the low single digits versus the high single digits, where it is today. On the asset side, yes, the softening in C&I loans, in particular, has been a contributor to things underperforming even recent estimates. And the question of where we go there, both the industry and Wells Fargo, will be, I think, at the margin, the swing factor in what happens for NII and for NIM over the course of the next year or so.\nAnd if we get a little bit of steepening, that would be very helpful. The way we're sort of looking at it, it's possible that we end up flat to down single-digit percentages in NIM knowing what we know today. As Charlie mentioned, the forecasting process isn't done for next year. And so there will be more guidance on that as that comes into clarity.\nBut those are probably the big drivers. Right now, also on the security side, you mentioned premium am, so we've got mortgage securities prepaying rapidly. We're replacing 2% yields with, call it, 140 basis point yields in the current yield, which will bring down the overall book average a little bit, too. So that's in our forecast, but it's a little bit different than the -- or a continuation of what happened in Q3.\nWe expect that premium amortization to continue right into next year.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nRight. John, can I just ask you to clarify? You said flat to down NIM, but did you mean NII dollars? Or could you just kind of rego through that again just so we all heard it right?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I meant NII, sorry, in dollars.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. And then can you help us understand what a steepener means in terms of like what does a 10-year delta do to your net interest income and to your point about just a helpful steepener, if we got it on an all-things-equal basis?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Well, it depends what we choose to do with it in terms of how much we redeploy. But if you could get the 10-year up toward 100 basis points, something like that, and we're talking about, I don't know, $1 billion or more of net interest income, again, it depends on how quickly we redeploy into that, what happens to mortgage yields at the same time. But we are sensitive at the long end of the curve.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thanks a lot, John.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. The feedback from the investor community essentially indicates that they understand that it's going to take time to have a thoughtful plan, especially on expenses. I think what's surprising the market today is the base upon which we're thinking about potential future gross reductions was a little bit higher than expected.\nSo I guess my first question is, as I take the restructuring charges out of the third-quarter run rate, that would imply $14.5 billion with elevated operating losses and suggesting an annual base of $58 billion. Is that the right expense base from which we should think about future gross reductions and also investments?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No, I would -- in our own math, we would also consider elevated operating losses to be more infrequent and not part of the run rate. So I get to a lower number on my own. I mean, the reported numbers are what they are and should be accounted for.\nBut as we're thinking about what's run rate and what's not, the elevated levels of operating losses, even though they have occurred now for a couple of quarters in a row, are not anticipated at this level. And restructuring charges, I'm certain there will be more, by the way, because that will be evidence that the company is making progress in its plans. But I wouldn't just consider that to be run rate either. So that would get you to a lower number.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Just a follow-up on that -- go ahead.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nGo ahead. Go ahead.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nJust a follow up with that, actually. So I think you've previously mentioned that a more normal level would be $600 million annually. And so if I take that elevated level out, then the base upon which we would then say, OK, this is the base, and then there's further improvement from here, would be $54 billion. Clearly, different math in terms of your future earnings power.\nIs that the right way to think about it?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nThat's how I think about it. Yes. That $600 million still seems like a good number. I think in this quarter, we have about $150 million worth of what we consider to be run-rate operating losses, fraud, robbery, and most standard things that have been in place for a long time.\nAnd what's above that is more episodic. And this quarter had much more to do with the closure of legacy types of issues.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. Very, very helpful. And just as a follow-up question to Ken's line of questioning. All three of your mega-cap bank peers essentially indicated that net interest income has either hit a bottom in the third quarter or will hit a bottom in the fourth quarter.\nAssuming no change in the outlook for rates and obviously, no change in terms of the asset cap, is that a statement that you're also confident in saying on NII bottoming?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nI mentioned it could get a little bit softer next year. Remember that we're operating with a with an asset cap that doesn't allow us to expand the size of the balance sheet and earn a little bit of incremental net interest income on these extra deposit balances that we're all gathering. And so at the margin, that could be a difference-maker. There are other things that go into what our level of NII is.\nBut at the margin, that's a constraint that we have that others don't.\nErika Najarian -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThank you for clarifying.\nOperator\nOur next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. Back to the expense discussion. On the $1 billion gross expense run rate reduction, could you maybe give us a little bit more detail around the timing of the realization of that? Could it be more front-end-loaded in terms of the annual impact?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So it is a gross number, but the impact will be immediate in the run rate because we've accelerated the costs associated with the actions, and those expenses will drop out.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. So it's more immediate impact there. OK. And then separately, in terms of the additional detail on the longer-term expenses, next quarter with fourth quarter, when you give us more details, could we get more of the larger expense opportunity detail in terms of potentially the $10 billion that was flagged before and maybe even an expense -- I mean, efficiency target beyond that? Just want to get an idea of what type of metrics, Charlie, that you might be in a position to give us.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK. I think it was -- between now and then, we'll figure out exactly what we're going to give you. What I said was that we will give you a clearer outlook as to what to expect for expenses for 2021 at the end of the quarter. We also said that you'll be seeing the disclosure of our segments broken out differently and much more comparable to what others report.\nAnd so you'll be able to see the gaps between our efficiency ratio by business and others. And just to be clear, what I said at the end of last quarter was all we did is we did the math of the people we compete against and said what's their efficiency ratio, looking at business mix and what's ours, and that's the difference. And so I assume you all do those calculations as well. We're acknowledging it.\nAnd those are the conversations that we have internally to say, is there any reason why our expense base shouldn't look different? So you'll actually -- so you'll see what those gaps are, and we'll certainly be in a position to talk about the types of things that we will be doing to close the gap, some of which will be in progress and others which will be to come.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. No, thank you. That's helpful. If I could just ask one more thing.\nOn the loan growth front, I know you mentioned that C&I is still -- you're seeing the pressure there, and that is a big factor in terms of your spread income outlook. Can you just give us some color around what you're seeing in terms of commercial demand? And could we see some improvement in C&I balances or at least stabilization here?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So there's a handful of things going on. At the upper end, for corporate and institutional borrowers, we're seeing continued utilization of the lines that they have but not a lot of incremental demand for more credit. In the middle market, there's a lot of different stories, but they can be summarized to saying that the utilization of existing facilities is down meaningfully to below pre-COVID levels.\nObviously, we all have the spike in the first part of the year that has abated. But in the middle market and including asset-based lending, we're seeing lower inventory levels held by customers who would use our financing to fund that inventory. Some of those may be coming back as inventories get rebuilt. Some of them may not.\nBut at the margin, that's pulling down balances. And also, I'd say on the high end. With the capital markets as wide open as they are, both for high-grade credit, as well as for more levered credit, that is replacing the utilization of bank lines by funding those things in the capital markets. And that's the story.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I'll just state the obvious, right, which is that ultimately, the path of the recovery is going to determine the levels of demand that are out there. And you can -- we do try to be very careful in our remarks about when it comes to credit, saying that it's too early to draw any conclusions. At the same time, as you look forward, as you get into next year, there will be a vaccine, there will be therapeutics. The world will continue to open, and everyone is learning how to do it safely, even in today's environment.\nAnd ultimately, that's what's going to drive business activity and demand, and that happens, we'll be the beneficiary.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. Thanks, Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nHy. OK. Good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, good morning.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nFirst of all, good luck on your future endeavors, John, and be sorry to not have you on these calls going forward. But I guess, first of all, I want to -- sorry to beat a dead horse with this question, but I just want to make sure I have a good handle for what we should expect. So the year-end results, we'll get the outlook for expenses in 2021 in addition to enhanced segment disclosure, which will allow us to, I guess, more effectively compare you to your peers on a segment basis. And I guess what's still a little bit unclear to me is what, if at all, is the plan to go beyond that and give maybe more far-reaching goals.\nAs you kind of continue to go through your strategic review, should we expect to see longer-term financial targets and expense-reduction plans and maybe long-term expense targets? Is that still the plan, and it'll be determined at a future date when you're able to and feel comfortable giving those targets? Or is that just kind of on hold for now?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I think three things, Saul. By the way, I completely appreciate the line of questioning. And so the fact that it's being asked a bunch, I completely understand. We have a couple of things that we need to get through.\nWe need to finish all of our internal work to understand what it takes to actually build the actions around becoming more effective and efficient at running the company. At the same time, we're continuing to invest to both build out the company and to do the regulatory and risk work that has to get done. There's no doubt that the environment that we're in today gives us pause in terms of committing to anything on a longer-term basis because then we'll show you a number, and then you're going to say, well, what's the timing? And obviously, it's very highly dependent on what the world looks like because of COVID, the asset cap because that obviously does impact our ability to grow the balance sheet and offset some of the NII reduction, which ultimately impacts the efficiency ratio. And so as we get more clarity around what those things look like, we will provide more detail.\nIt's just not clear when the right time to do that is, but we'll tell you everything we know when we know it.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nOne more thing to add, Saul. So what you'll see at the end of the year is that the results as they reflect 2020 will also show the results of some strategic decisions that have already been made. So that will be helpful at the margin.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. No, that's helpful. I want to go back to Erika's line of questioning on how to think about sort of a more normalized basis of expenses currently.\nAnd I think a lot of us have been kind of normalizing the op losses to the $600 million or $150 million a quarter. I mean, I guess my question there is, like, why is that the right number because you haven't been anywhere near that number for quarter -- it seems like five years. And I guess I get the normal amount of fraud and whatnot, but it's been much, much higher than that for a very long time. Heck, even before the sales issues.\nAnd I guess -- so is that really the right number? And I guess maybe a more important question is, when do you feel like you'll have some of these customer -- or these litigation accruals that have been pretty elevated in three of the last four quarters kind of running their course and coming back down?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. So I guess I'll start, and John, you can add. I would say, when we look at the customer remediation accruals for both this quarter and last quarter, they're very discrete items where we went through all of the items that we have in our customer remediation queue, of which everything material relates to prior practices that have been around for a period of time. We're working really hard to put these behind us and put these behind us means determine exactly what we're going to do for remediation, work with our regulators where necessary to make sure that they understand what that means.\nAnd what we did over the past couple of quarters is to try and go through the entire inventory to ensure that we were current and realistic about what our actions are and what we're going to do to move these on. And so we've done that. I wish it would have taken one quarter as opposed to two, but it took two. And not that there won't be anything going forward, but we don't see anything that looks at all, materiality, of the types of things that we've done.\nAnd so we think those things are booked. It's in a good place, and we're just doing the work to implement them now.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd then in recent years, there have been this kind of range of litigation, but there's been two big pieces of litigation that have contributed to this in a way that's not expected to recur, one being, at that point, 10-year-old RMBS settlement, where we were among the last people to be brought into the settlement process. And then of course the sales practices-related litigation that was settled earlier this year. And that, similarly, is not expected to recur. So I get your point, which is it's been elevated for a long time.\nBut when you disaggregate it and look at what is the run rate in the business, we mentioned that adds up to roughly $600 million a year versus what things are specifically related to what I would describe as legacy issues, that is where the line gets drawn. The proof will be in demonstrating [Inaudible] $600 million or below would be helpful.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nYeah. Helpful, yeah. Yeah. Well, it's been a while since you've been there, and you've been talking about that number for a while.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nActually, in the second quarter of 2020, it was $464 million. So that's an example.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. But like the NII guide, just final one, just clarity. When you say flat or down, that's full-year '21 versus '20? Because it seems hard to be flat given kind of your run rate as you exit 2020.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. It depends on what happens with loan growth. That's a good point. But that is the full year versus the full year.\nSaul Martinez -- UBS -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nGood morning. So wanted to start off, John, with just a question on liquidity management. We've heard different messages from your peers regarding appetite to redeploy excess liquidity into MBS and help mitigate some NII pressures. You're currently running with, arguably, the largest excess liquidity pool of all the money center banks, and I was hoping you could frame the potential benefit from remixing into higher-yielding securities.\nAnd is any of that contemplated in the NII guidance that you provided for next year?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. What's contemplated is a continuation of roughly the same level of deployment, which just requires redeployment, given the rate at which things are prepaying. So there's a question about how long you want to get in a sub-1% 10-year environment with mortgage yields at these levels. In the event of a backup, it's a problem.\nIt's a capital problem. It's an earnings problem versus the trade-off of what happens if rates stay low for a very long time, or frankly, go lower from here or even go negative and what that means from an earnings power perspective. And so those discussions, those trade-offs are measured and revisited each time we have an algo discussion given what the forward look is for what could happen to rates and deposit flows and loan demand and other things. So we have liquidity available for loan demand.\nWe certainly could redeploy tens of billions of dollars into MBS or probably even more into similar-duration treasuries. There's some liquidity difference in the characteristics there. But I think, as you heard from at least one of our competitors, really loading up at these levels and locking into both duration and/or negative convexity doesn't seem like a great trade-off. And so we're faced with those same choices.\nAnd right now, we're essentially redeploying to stay at about the same level.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nIf I can just add. So in terms of how we think about the opportunity and also how it factors into the asset cap. So just trying to be clear about what I tried to say before, which is we have an asset cap that we have to live with, but we do have some room to operate as we sit here today because of the liquidity that we have, because of where the balance sheet is actually running today, because of other actions that we've taken, and as we think about exiting some things that can create some balance sheet room for us. And so while we don't have the same capacity that others have, we do have capacity to deploy more of our capital toward loans than we've currently deployed.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nRight. That's right.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThat's great. Thank you both for the color. And then maybe just a question for you, Charlie, on the expense outlook. I'm going to try to take a different tack here.\nGiven that one of the biggest sources of pushback that we've we hear from investors is that while the opportunity to drive expenses lower is quite clear and evident, the risk is that revenue attrition is difficult to handicap and could be greater than anticipated, especially given how significant the revenue attrition has been since the last investor day update, recognizing you were not in the seat at that time. But just curious, as you begin executing on the cost plans and headcount reductions, what efforts are you taking to help limit revenue attrition? And your confidence level that you can achieve efficiency gains while protecting revenues.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. I guess let me answer it a couple of ways. First of all, when we take a look at just what's happened to the franchise in terms of attrition, I mean, the reality of who we are is we are more of a traditional consumer and commercial bank than some of the other large competitors we compete with. And so the reduction in NII in those businesses has an outsized impact on us relative to the others because of the business mix.\nAnd so that revenue decline is not franchise loss in terms of what it means to customer relationships. When we look at the individual businesses and how they're performing from a customer franchise in our consumer business, in our middle market business, in our wealth business, as well as the large corporate business, I actually look at and say it's been extraordinarily strong given all this company has been through. When we think about the actions that we're going to take. First of all, for things that we are going to exit, it doesn't either fit with what we do or have the right return characteristics.\nAnd so those are a core set of decisions, which when we go through them and you see what they are, you'll hopefully look and see if that makes sense given who Wells Fargo is. And then the other actions that we're taking are all about improving the franchise. And so just to be clear, and I tried to say this in my remarks, we're not going around saying we have to cut X billions of dollars and everyone line up and just do it. It is about what do we have to do to run a better company so that we can be more efficient internally at getting work done and deliver a better-quality product for our customers business by business.\nThere's a gigantic amount of redundancy in multiple platforms across common products, common processes. Those are the types of things that are going to drive the efficiency of the company, but it will make us a better-run company. And so we have an extremely heightened antenna when it comes to anything, which impacts the risk work or could hurt the value of the franchise. And in fact, as I said, the conversations around doing everything to help the value of the franchise.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThat's great. Thanks, Charlie, for all the color. And, John, best of luck with your future endeavors.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you very much.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions, Charlie, John. Let me just start with one clarification. Charlie, you talked about the fact that the operating losses, you've been trying to work on this for the last couple of quarters.\nI want to check in on one thing. The reimbursements, you're trying to make sure that, where you needed to, expand the horizon in terms of customers, time period, etc. Given that we're concerned about the run rate of this number going forward, has that been signed off by regulators? Or is there still that process to come so that there's some potential that that could change because of the regulatory angle to it?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Without being specific about whether something signed off on by regulators, I'd say that we have a -- the belief is, by the business leadership and everybody around it, that we've arrived at the right numbers that make sense for customers, put these issues behind Wells Fargo and shouldn't be met with any disagreement.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. OK. Let me shift gears. Just a quick one.\nTreasury management, you talked about fee revenues this time in your slide deck. Normally, you've talked about total revenues. Can you give us what the total revenue did for treasury management? I know that's an important business for you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, it is. And it gets split between the commercial business and the corporate business. I know that the way we're describing it, I think, is there's a trade-off between NII for earnings, credit rate, and fee revenue. So the way we've described it in the deck is sort of -- is all of the specifics we're putting on it right now.\nWe can talk about breaking it out a little bit more now that we're in a rate environment where we don't have to pay customers through treasury management fees for putting noninterest-bearing deposits with us. But I don't have any more clarity for you right now.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nOK. One last thing, Charlie, in terms of the businesses that you're talking about, the operations. Wealth Management operating margin was only 16% this quarter. Pretty low given what you folks have also delivered in the past.\nAny color, any granularity on what's keeping it so low? Is there a potential to improve that through any business changes?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThere's certainly a possibility of it. I mean, it's a question of what we're generating in loan spread, and loan yields in that business have come down. I think there's a belief by the new leadership in that business that there's a much bigger opportunity for securities-based lending among other types of lending for wealth customers that we haven't really tapped in the past. So that's probably going to be margin-enhancing.\nOn the core fee generation business, the margin isn't likely to change very much given the relatively linear connection between revenue and expense.\nVivek Juneja -- J.P. Morgan -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGood morning, John. Good morning, Charlie. John, can you share with us -- on the premium amortization, you guys obviously have seen this in the past and in past cycles. And I know you said it's going to continue to be enforced on the margin going into '21.\nIf interest rates stay at this level, when do you think it will start to meaningfully come down from the current level? And second, what kind of impact has the Fed having on keeping the yields down in this market with their active buying, which -- actively buying the mortgage-backed securities?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. So a meaningful impact is just a quick answer to the second half of your question. I would expect the pace of premium amortization to stay in place throughout 2021. Mortgage securities, in part because of the Fed and in part because of the industry's ability to sort of shift and even speed up, take frictions out of the refinancing process, which speeds up prepayments.\nI think we're operating at about 35 CPR right now. That isn't going away. Whether it's virtual inspections, virtual tours, paperless closings -- or at least electronic closings, etc., it's made it easier and easier for people to refi. And that's going to keep speeding things up.\nWe think we've accounted for that in the way that we measure that risk in different parts of our business, but I don't think it's going away. And eventually, we'll have a burn out of the in-the-money-ness of the stock of mortgage securities, but there's still a long way to go. I think we mentioned that our expectation for our Q4, very near term, but our Q4 looks a lot like Q3 in terms of volume and margin. And I think as Charlie mentioned, we're operating at capacity and so is much of the industry.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. And pivoting to you, Charlie. I know the asset cap is not what I'm asking about with this question, but you did point out that you guys are spending a tremendous amount of time on getting everything right with the regulators. If you're comfortable, can you give us a timeline of when you send in the documents, when do the regulators start to see the work that you've done? I assume it's already under way.\nBut where we could kind of then figure out maybe the regulators could give us outside of a decision that, yes, you guys are out of the penalty box and is off to the races?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAgain, I think it's a hard question to answer. What I'll say is -- so the regulators are alongside us every single day. They see exactly what we're doing. They see how we're organized.\nThey see whether we've got the right sense of urgency. So they don't just sit in their offices and wait for us to send them something and then they study it and react. They're there, side by side with us, and we have extremely active dialogue with them, as all the big banks do. And for us, that's a good thing because we want them to see what we're doing, how we're doing it, and how it's different than we tackled these issues in the past.\nMy experience has been when we ask them something very specific or whether we -- when we give them something and submit something to them, they're thorough, but they're very timely in their response. How that actually plays out with a consent order, again, I don't know. What we're focused on is doing the work, having them see the progress. And hopefully, the work will be done to our satisfaction and their satisfaction.\nAnd we'll move forward at the right time.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you for the insights. Appreciate it.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nOur final question will come from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHey, guys. A couple of quick cleanups here. Wrapping up, John, just on the CET1, how much does that change impact CET1, the RWA, the new measurement? Any idea, just kind of framework for how much that hits?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Well, you can see in the deck what the comparisons have been for the last -- those measurement points. I mean, today, they're basically on top of each other. The question is what happens to RWA as internal risk ratings change with the passage of time.\nAnd so we expect to be well above our minimums, our own targets, etc. It's not really an issue. But if it pops around by tens of basis points or something, I just want people to know that that's just the -- that's the regulatory framework that we're operating in. There's nothing new or different about the credit risks and these loans.\nIt's accounted for in our allowance, and we've been a standardized, constrained bank since this regulatory regime came into place. And now that might change for a period of time as we work through the pandemic. But I don't anticipate it being that meaningful, and it's the same dollars of capital protecting the same book of loans.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. OK. Got it. And then just one more on the NII.\nFor the fourth quarter, is your guidance implying that NII is relatively flat to the third quarter?\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. It's flattish. I don't think we have specific guidance, but I wouldn't expect it to move around that much in the quarter.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And then if you operated at the fourth quarter annualized, if we annualize that and next year and compare that to the $40 billion for this year, that would be down mid-single digits. So I got a couple of questions of people asking how would it be flat year over year. It's like you'd have to have loan growth, right, for it to be flat, and you have an asset cap.\nJohn Shrewsberry -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. You have to have loan growth or a steepening and redeployment. A handful of things would have to go right for it to be flat. So that's why I think that's a reasonable range of expectation, flat to down mid-single digits.\nAnd we'll give more clarity on that as the budget process is complete and we get closer to the beginning of the year, but those are the drivers.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And then the last thing just for Charlie. Charlie, just to kind of clarify what you're hoping to do on communications and the timeline, so in January, you'll give us some expense guidance for '21 once you've gotten to think through that some more. So we'll get an expense guide for next year in January.\nBut in terms of kind of the further details, like longer-term aspirations for ROE and efficiency and long-term cost potential, is that going to be later on, and that depends? If you could just clarify what the time frames are for road maps, that would be great.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYou know, I think it depends on how much work we've done over the multiyear period and having bottoms-up, supportable plans that we have the confidence to share; where we are in COVID; and ultimately, thinking about the interest rate environment as well. Because clearly, as we think about our efficiency ratio, revenue these days has a very meaningful impact. But as we do our work on expenses, we're taking actions. You see that in the charge this quarter.\nAnd the reserves that we provided for these actions will be taken this year, and so you'll see the positive impact next year. And so the actions that we're building are very real. It's a question of when it all comes together in terms of understanding the regulatory piece, the necessary investment piece, and the expense cuts. So again, I think we just have to take it one quarter a time and understand that people want to see progress on a net basis.\nOperator\nI'll now turn the conference back over for any further remarks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAll right, everyone, thank you very much for the time.

{"date": "Jul 14, 2023, 10:00 a.m. ET", "exchange": "NYSE: WFC", "q": "2023-Q2", "ticker": "WFC", "transcript": "Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nWelcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo second-quarter 2023 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nGood morning. Thank you, everyone, for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss second-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second-quarter results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review second-quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some second-quarter highlights.\nWe had solid results in the quarter with revenue, pre-tax pre-provision profit, diluted earnings per share, and ROTCE all higher than a year ago. The revenue growth reflected strong net interest income growth, as well as higher non-interest income. While our efficiency ratio improved and we continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives, we had modest expense growth from a year ago. Net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels, but overall credit quality was strong and consumer and business balance sheets remain healthy.\nWe increased our allowance for credit losses by $949 million, primarily driven by our office portfolio, as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. While we haven't seen significant losses in our office portfolio today, our detailed loan-by-loan review of the portfolio has given us a sense how the next several quarters could play out. We also considered a number of stressed scenarios, all of which informed our actions this quarter. Mike will discuss this in more detail, but I want to make the point that it is very hard to look at any one statistic and determine the risk in the portfolio.\nLoss content will be driven by a combination of factors including but not limited to: property type, location, lease rates, lease renewal notice states, loan structure, and borrower behavior. Most importantly, our CRE teams remain focused on working with our clients for its portfolio surveillance and derisking to minimize loss content. Both commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago but were down from the first quarter as the economy has slowed, and we've taken some credit taking actions. Credit card spending remains strong, but the rate of growth has slowed from the outsized growth rates we saw for 2022.\nDebit card spending was flat from a year ago, with growth in discretionary spend, offset by declines in nondiscretionary spends. Average deposits were down from the first quarter, driven by lower consumer deposits, while the decline in commercial deposits slowed. Now, let me update you on progress we've made on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work. Regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues such as ours continues to grow, and as such, our continued intensive effort to complete the build-out of an appropriate risk and control framework for a company of our size and complexity is critical.\nI continue to emphasize that this is our top priority and will remain so. And that while we have implemented substantial portions of the work required, we have more implementation to do, as well as work to make sure the changes operate effectively over time. As I said before, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions until the work is complete. While we're devoting all necessary resources to our risk and control work, we're also continuing to invest in our business to better serve our customers and help drive growth.\nOur consumer customers have continued to increase their use of our mobile app. We added over 1 million mobile active customers over the past year, and mobile logins increased 9% from a year ago. Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant is now live on our mobile app for all consumer customers. Since launching at the end of April, our customers have interacted with Fargo over 4 million times.\nWe've continued to make important hires, bringing new expertise to Wells Fargo in businesses we are looking to grow. We named Barry Simmons as the new head of national sales and wealth and investment management. It will be critical in our efforts to better serve clients and help advisors grow their business. We also continued to attract veteran bankers in corporate and investment banking, hiring new managing directors in our banking division in priority growth areas, including a co-head of global mergers and acquisitions, co-head of financial institutions, and new heads of financial sponsors, equity capital markets, healthcare, and technology, media, and telecom.\nWe also continue to focus on better serving our communities. We announced a 10-year strategic partnership with TD JX Group that could result in up to $1 billion in capital and financing from Wells Fargo to drive economic vitality and inclusivity in communities across America. The Wells Fargo Foundation were at $7.5 million to Habitat for Humanity to build and repair more than 360 homes nationwide. We've worked with Habitat for Humanity for nearly three decades and donated more than $129 million since 2010.\nWells Fargo signed on as the first anchor funder of UnidosUS HOME initiative to create 4 million new Latino homeowners by 2030. We provided the initial grants to start a fund launched by fintech Hello Alice to improve access to credit and capital for small business owners who are members of underserved groups, including women. We continue to open hope inside centers on Wells Fargo branches, including six during the first half of 2023, with plans to reach 20 markets by the end of this year. The centers help empower community members to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching.\nWe published our 2023 diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which highlights the progress we've made in our DE&I strategy and initiatives both inside our company and the communities where we live and work. However, we have more work to do to achieve enduring results that will require for long-term commitments. Looking ahead, the U.S. economy continues to perform better than many expected.\nAnd although there will likely be continued economic slowing and uncertainty remains, it is quite possible the range of scenarios will narrow over the next few quarters. This year's Federal Reserve stress test affirmed that we remain in a strong capital position, reflecting the value of our franchise and benefits of our operating model. This capital strength allows us to serve our customers' financial needs while continuing to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders. As we previously announced, we expect to increase our third-quarter common stock dividend by 17% to $0.35 per share, subject to approval by the company's board of directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month.\nWe've repurchased $8 billion of common stock during the first half of this year and the stress test results demonstrated that we have the capacity to continue to repurchase common stock. Regulators have signaled that the Basel III endgame proposal, which could be out as soon as this summer, will include higher capital requirements that would be skewed to the country's largest banks. While there's some speculation that capital requirements could increase by 20%, we don't know what the impact will be to Wells Fargo, however, we do expect our capital requirements will increase. While any changes to regulatory capital requirements are expected to be phased in gradually over several years, we are considering the potential impact in contemplating the amount of our future repurchases.\nOur balance sheet is strong. We've increased and remained focused on increasing our earnings capacity and continue to like our competitive position. We remain prepared for a variety of scenarios and our steadfast commitment to our risk and control build-out, coupled with our continued focus on financial and credit risk management allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was 4.9 billion or $1.25 per diluted common share, both up from a year ago, reflecting the progress we are making on improving our performance, which I'll highlight throughout the call. Starting with capital liquidity on Slide 3. Our CET1 ratio was 10.7%, down approximately 10 basis points from the first quarter.\nDuring the second quarter, we repurchased 4 billion in common stock, and as Charlie highlighted, subject to board approval, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter. Our CET1 ratio was 1.5 percentage points above our current regulatory minimum plus buffers and was 1.8 percentage points above our expected new regulatory minimum plus buffer starting in the fourth quarter of this year. While we expect to repurchase more common stock this year, we believe continuing to maintain significant excess capital is appropriate until there is more clarity on the new capital requirements that Charlie highlighted. Our liquidity position remains strong in the second quarter with our liquidity coverage ratio approximately 23 percentage points above the regulatory minimum.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 5. Overall, credit quality remained strong, but as expected, net loan charge-offs continue to increase from historically low levels and were 32 basis points of average loans in the second quarter. Commercial net loan charge-offs increased 137 million from the first quarter to 15 basis points of average loans. Approximately half of the increase was in commercial banking where the losses were borrower-specific with little signs of systematic weakness across the portfolio.\nThe rest of the increase was driven by higher losses in commercial real estate, primarily in the office portfolio. I'll share some more details on the CRE office exposure on the next slide. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased modestly, up 23 million from the first quarter to 58 basis points of average loans. The increase primarily came from the credit card portfolio as residential mortgage loans continue to have net recoveries and auto losses declined.\nWhile consumer credit performance remained solid overall, and we've continued to take incremental credit exciting actions across the portfolios, we expect consumer net loan charge-offs will continue to gradually increase. Nonperforming assets increased 14% from the first quarter as lower nonaccrual loans across the consumer portfolios were more than offset by higher commercial nonaccrual loans, primarily in the commercial real estate portfolio. Our allowance for credit losses increased 949 million in the second quarter, primarily from commercial real estate office loans, as well as for higher credit card balances. We've updated Slide 6, which highlights our commercial real estate portfolio.\nWe had 154.3 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the second quarter with 33.1 billion of office loans, which were down modestly from the first quarter and represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. The office market continues to be weak and the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the first quarter. As Charlie mentioned, our CRE teams are focused on surveillance and derisking, which includes reducing exposures and closely monitoring at-risk loans. This quarter, we added a table to this slide that breaks down our CRE office exposure in the context of our broader CRE portfolio.\nAs the slide shows, our office loans at the end of the second quarter were primarily in corporate investment banking and that is also where we had the most nonaccrual loans in the highest level of allowance for credit losses. Last quarter, we disclosed for the first time the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for the office portfolio in the corporate investment bank, which increased from 5.7% at the end of the first quarter to 8.8% at the end of the second quarter. This quarter, we are also providing our allowance for credit losses for our total CRE office portfolio, which was 6.6% at the end of the second quarter, up from 4.4% at the end of the first quarter. As we've highlighted last quarter, we're providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but each property situation is different, and there are many variables that can determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis.\nFor example, we have properties that are experiencing increased vacancies where borrowers have decided to inject equity and make investments to improve the property even in cities with more difficult fundamentals. We also have properties that are well leased to performing, but borrowers need health refinancing. In those situations, we are working with farmers to restructure, which in many cases, include some paydown of the balance. There are also situations that result in a sale or work out of the asset.\nWe will continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help resolve issues that they may be facing. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were relatively stable in the first quarter and were up 2% from a year ago, driven by higher commercial and industrial loans and commercial banking and credit card loans. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results.\nAverage loan yields increased 247 basis points from a year ago and 30 basis points from the first quarter due to the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 7% from a year ago, predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. While down from a year ago, average commercial deposits were relatively stable from the first quarter, and average deposits grew in corporate loan investment banking. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase up 30 basis points from the first quarter to 113 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to the rising interest rates.\nOur mix of noninterest-bearing deposits declined from 32% in the first quarter to 30% in the second quarter but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Second-quarter net interest income was 13.2 billion, up 29% from a year ago as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $173 million decline from the first quarter was primarily due to lower deposit balances, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter.\nAt the beginning of the year, we expected full-year net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared with 2022. We currently expect full year 2023 net interest income to increase approximately 14% compared with 2022. There are a variety of factors that we've considered in our expectations for the rest of the year. We are assuming modest growth in loans with some additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits, as well as continued deposit repricing, including competitive pricing on commercial deposits.\nAdditionally, we are using recent -- the recent rate curve, which is shown on the slide. As a reminder, many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain, and we will need to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year. Turning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense grew 125 million or 1% from a year ago.\nAt the beginning of the year, we expected our full year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses, to be approximately 50.2 billion. We currently expect our full year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses to be approximately 51 billion. The increase includes higher severance expense due to actions we have taken in the plan -- and plan to take in 2023 as attrition has been slower than expected. Of note, we've reduced headcount each quarter since the third quarter of 2020 and headcount declined 1% from the first quarter and 4% from a year ago.\nAs a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses. Turning to our operating segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 10. Consumer and small business banking revenue increased 19% from a year ago as higher net interest income, driven by the impact of higher interest rates, was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. We continue to reduce the underlying cost to run the business as customers migrate to digital, including mobile.\nWe've reduced our number of branches by 4% and branch staffing by 10% from a year ago. Home lending revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by the lower net interest income due to loan spread compression and lower mortgage originations. We continue to reduce headcount in the second quarter, down 37% from a year ago, and we expect that staffing levels will further decline during the second half of the year. Credit card revenue increased 1% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\nPayment rates were down for a year ago, but have been stable over the last 3 quarters and remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth remained strong, up 17% from a year ago, and importantly, the quality of the new accounts continue to be better than what we were booking historically. Auto revenue declined 13% from a year ago, driven by the continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue was up 17% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 77% from a year ago and increased 18% from the first quarter, reflecting seasonality. We funded our last correspondent loan in the second quarter with our current focus being serving our bank customers, as well as borrowers in minority communities. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for five consecutive quarters and balances were down 7% at the end of the second quarter compared to a year ago.\nOrigination volume declined 11% from a year ago, reflecting credit-tightening actions, as well as continued price competition. As Charlie highlighted, debit card spend was flat in the second quarter compared to a year ago, spending on fuel due to lower gas prices, home improvement and travel at the largest declines compared to last year. Credit card spending continued to be strong and was up 13% from a year ago. Growth rates were stable throughout the second quarter with fuel the only category down year over year.\nTurning to commercial banking results on Slide 12. The middle market banking revenue increased 51% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 13% year over year, primarily due to higher loan balances. Average loan balances were up 12% in the second quarter compared to a year ago, driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization.\nAverage loan balances have grown for eight consecutive quarters and the pace of growth has slowed. Average loans were up 1% from the first quarter with loan growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by seasonally higher inventory levels, while middle market banking loans were flat. Turning to corporate investment banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher lending revenue.\nThe growth in investment banking fees from a year ago reflected write-downs taken in the second quarter of 2022 on an unfunded leveraged finance movements. Commercial real estate revenue grew 26% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Markets revenue increased 29% from a year ago, driven by the higher trading results across most asset classes. Our strong trading results during the first half of the year were driven by underlying market conditions and also reflected the benefit of our investments in technology and talent, which have allowed us to broaden our client franchise and generate more trading flows.\nAverage loans were down 2% from a year ago and 1% from the first quarter. The decline in the first quarter was driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slow demand and modestly lower line utilization. On Slide 14, wealth and investment management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago, driven by a decline in asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income from a year ago was driven by the impact of higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives.\nHowever, outflows into cash alternatives slowed in the second quarter. As a reminder, the majority of win advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so second-quarter results reflected the market valuations as of April 1st, which were down from a year ago. Asset-based fees in the third quarter will reflect higher market valuations as of July 1st. Average loans were down 3% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending.\nNow, Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. Revenue increased 751 million from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and lower impairments of equity securities in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. In summary, our results in the second quarter reflected continued improvement in our earnings capacity. We grew revenue and had strong growth in pre-tax provision profit.\nAs expected, our net charge-offs continue to slowly increase from historical lows, and our allowance for credit losses increased. We are slowly -- we are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit-tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels remain strong and we continue to repurchase common stock. We will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\nThank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please stand by for our first question. Our first question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies.\nYour line is open, sir. Mr. Usdin, please check the mute button on your phone.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWhy don't we take another one, and then we'll come back to Ken?\nOperator\nCertainly. The next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nMorning, everyone. Thank you for taking the question. Hey, it was great to see the higher NII guide and the performance this quarter. That said, it seems likely the dollars of NII will come down from here.\nI guess, just broadly speaking, are you able to chat about what factors might be most important and just sort of your ability to arrest a downward move in NII? In other words, kind of when and why would it end up flattening out if we're ideally getting close to the end of a fed-tightening cycle.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Thanks, Scott. It's Mike. I'll take that, and Charlie can jump in if he wants.\nWhen you look at the assumptions and the -- that underpin that, and I highlighted some of this in my script, but I'll kind of go back through them. We've got a little bit of modest loan growth in there. So, that's not a big driver of sort of what we're seeing. And I think you're probably seeing that from others where we're just not seeing that same demand that we saw a year or so ago on sort of on loans.\nWe're also assuming that we'll see some additional outflows, particularly in the consumer space as people continue to spend money. And then, we'll see some more migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits. And then, deposit pricing will -- betas will evolve over time. I think it's still very competitive on the commercial side, and I think that will continue on the consumer side that will evolve.\nSo, I think you got to look at those combination of factors and make some assumptions around when you think they start to stabilize. And -- but I think we're assuming that those trends that we've been seeing now for the last couple of quarters will continue at least through the year-end.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK. Perfect. And maybe if we could drill down into one of those in particular, just the migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing. They've come down but still above pre-pandemic levels, I believe.\nDo you have a sense for where and why those would start to settle out?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, there's a few factors underneath that. As you pointed out, we're about 30% at the end of the quarter, down from about 32, I think the prior quarter. And if you go back pre-COVID, they were in kind of the mid-20s, mid to upper 20s, depending on when exactly when you look at it.\nSo, -- so -- and we've been trending downward. Part of that is excess deposits on the commercial side. As people use up their earnings credits for the fees they're paying, you're seeing some migration there. That stabilizes.\nAnd then, you've seen, again, on the consumer side, people spending from their primary checking accounts. So, those are the factors that I look at on when that starts to slow down and stabilize, but it's been pretty consistent, at least for the last quarter or two.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK. All right. Thank you very much, Mike.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. So, Mike, thanks for the details on the CRE book. I think Charlie mentioned that you've gone through loan by loan in identifying. And I appreciate the desynchratic nature of every sort of CRE loan.\nBut given the reserve you've taken this quarter, give us a sense of your visibility around how well deserved the bank is today knowing what we know in terms of the macro outlook. And also, if you can comment on just the rest of the CRE book, particularly as it relates to San Francisco or California and your level of comfort around just apartments, etc. within that market. Thank you. \nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, thanks. I'll take that. It's Mike. Broadly, I'll start on the broader point on CRE, and I'll come back to office.\nI think we've gone through the multifamily portfolio in quite a lot of detail. And I think -- I'm talking about the broader portfolio first, right? And so, you talked about apartments in some cities. And so, I think when you look at the broader portfolio, including multifamily, it's all performing quite well. And I think you've seen certainly a slowing of growth rates in rents, but they're not declining in most cases.\nYou're seeing good occupancy rates in many of the new construction that's coming online. And so, overall, it feels quite constructive still for multifamily. And that same theme really applies to the rest of the portfolio. On office, that's the place where we're certainly seeing weakness.\nAnd as you think about the allowance we put up, we do have some very specific borrower loan level estimates of what we think could play out over the next quarter -- next couple -- next few quarters, and that's embedded in the allowance. And then, as you look at the rest of the office portfolio, we've gone through a number of stress scenarios and feel like at this point, we're appropriately reserved to be able to deal with what could be a number of different scenarios depending on how it plays out over time.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. And I guess just a separate question. I mean, you obviously have ample capital. Just, Charlie, from your standpoint, how impactful is the asset cap today? Given the squeeze on the rest of the industry, I would think Wells would actually be gaining market share.\nBut is the asset cap and all the regulatory issues, I'm not going to ask you to give us a timeline, but is that still a meaningful challenge in terms of your ability to take market share?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, I mean, you can look at the size of our balance sheet and see where it is relative to the asset cap, which is 1.952 trillion, I think.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThat's the asset cap.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYep. That's the actual cap, remember, which is a daily average over a couple of quarters. So, relative to where we're operating today, we feel like we still have plenty of balance sheet to serve our customers. And it's not standing in the way of that hasn't always been the case, but I think that's where we are today.\nBut putting just the pure economics of the asset cap aside, it is something that when we look at the work we have to get done, the fact that it's there is a statement of the reality that we still have more work to do. And so, it's critical that we continue on our road to complete that work. And so, that's the way we're thinking about it today.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd maybe I'll just add one thing. When you look at some of the growth opportunities we have, Charlie highlighted some of the investment banking hires we're making. In large part, we already have the exposure out to the client base there. So, now it's about making sure we've got the right people to go after the fee opportunity, not necessarily extending a lot more balance sheet, wealth management and the growth opportunity there, same theme.\nAnd even in the card space, as we look at the refresh product line is doing really well. We've got more to come there. And I think we've got plenty of room to continue to support many of the growth opportunities we have even if we didn't put out more -- have more exposure to support it.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGood color. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nGood morning.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nSo, I wanted to start off with a question just on the NII outlook. Certainly encouraging to see the guidance increase. But you noted, Mike, that it does contemplate a modest level of loan growth. And just parsing some of your other comments where you alluded to credit tightening, signs of slowdown in the broader economy, what gives you confidence around some inflection in lending activity, especially given the flattish loan growth that we've seen this quarter?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Well, I think we're seeing -- we're certainly seeing growth in card. So, I think we would expect that to continue. And then, in the rest of the portfolios, we see a little bit of growth in the asset-based lending and leasing business in the commercial bank.\nMiddle market is kind of flat, at least this quarter, and then you can see the consumer items. So, I think we're hopeful that we'll see some growth as we go into the second quarter. But as always, Steven, what we try to do with guidance is give you guidance that it doesn't necessarily require every assumption to go in our favor. So, the bigger drivers of uncertainty around NII for the rest of the year continue to be the same ones we've been talking about now for the last couple of quarters.\nIt's really going to be deposits and deposit pricing. The loan story will matter, but not anywhere near to the same degree.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nNo, it's helpful color. And just a follow-up on expense. You cited the headcount reductions and higher severance costs driving some upward pressure this year. But just wanted to better understand how we should be thinking about the exit rate on expense once the headcount actions that you cited are fully captured in the run rate, and whether there's any plans to maybe redeploy some of the NII windfall to reinvest back in the business as we think about some of the potential benefits and the higher NII guidance you cited.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I think our focus on expenses really hasn't changed over the last quarter or two. As we've talked about now for a while, we're going to continue to be very disciplined around the expense base. I think we're very much focused on making sure we execute and achieve the efficiencies that we've talked about.\nAnd as we get to year-end, we'll sort of look at and after we do our work around the budget for next year, we'll go back through all the ups and downs like we normally do and give you some perspective there. But really the thinking around it hasn't changed.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd let me just add, if it's OK. I think when we laid out our expense guidance, we got a series of questions about how we think of the variability of that number and the environment and will the rest of our results impact that number. And I think as we look at how we're performing, I think we -- it wouldn't be hard for us to make a bunch of decisions to hit an expense number. But to the point is, we -- our results have been relatively strong, and so, we are doing a series of things.\nI don't think about it as onetime expenses, but we have -- there is a fair amount of subjective expenses that relate to business development, product enhancements, and things like that that we do have the ability to each year, each quarter, look at how we're performing and decide how much we want to spend. And so, as we look forward, I think we're going to wait and see as we go through our budgeting process, and we do a series of scenarios in terms of how things could play out next year and then make that determination. But as Mike said, I think we do separate out the fact that we continue to believe that there are continued opportunities to drive efficiency throughout the company. We're not going to lose sight of that.\nAnd that is separate from how much do we want to spend away from that. And we'll talk more about that toward the end of the year.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHelpful color. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. Wanted to see if we can get some of your updated thoughts on buybacks here. CET1, 10.7% and you indicated the 4 billion buyback in 2Q, when you expect to continue to buyback from here. But obviously, Basel III end game is a factor.\nAnd I heard you on that you're contemplating buybacks as you look out from here. So, could you maybe help frame that for us what that could mean in terms of the pace of repurchases? Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nNot really any more than -- I think that's -- I think what we said is as much clarity as we want to give at this time. I think we are -- we have substantial excess capital above the regulatory requirements and regulatory buffers and on top of the level of buffers that we have talked about running at. And so, we think that's prudent given the fact that it's likely that capital requirements are going up. But the reality to answer the -- just in terms of the timing and in terms of the ability to answer the question, from everything that we read is the same thing that you read, it's likely that we will learn later this month or early next month exactly what the proposal is.\nAnd based upon that, it will help us inform exactly how much room we have for buybacks. But there are most of the scenarios that we see, there is room for us to continue the buyback program in a prudent way and still build the required capital to whatever levels we'd have to require -- to be required to build a math and keep the kind of buffers that we want to keep. So, there are a bunch of moving pieces here. And so it's just -- it doesn't make sense to put any more numbers on it until we actually see what those proposals are.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you. That's helpful. And then, separately, on the NII side, again, I appreciate the updated guide for '23 of the 14%.\nMaybe can you talk about when you look at the forward curves, what could be the forward curve implications for NII as you look further out into 2024? If we do reach a Fed funds of around 4% implied by the forward curve, how much of a headwind to NII could that be for you? And maybe also if you could just talk about the near-term deposit trajectory? I know you mentioned still continued decline. I don't know if you can help frame that, size it up. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, John. I'm not going to give you much clarity on 2024. But I think the things you should think about, obviously, are going to be as rate -- on the commercial side, rate -- betas on the way up are pretty high, betas on the way down are pretty high. And the consumer side really hasn't moved much at this point.\nAnd so, I do -- you sort of have to go into your modeling, looking at each of the components a little bit differently. And as we -- and I think many others have talked about over time, like once rates peak, there is likely some lag of continued repricing for a while after rates peak. And so, you've got to think about all of -- all of how that goes in your model. And then, I think as I said in my script, I think we've seen pretty consistent performance across deposits over the last couple of quarters.\nAnd we're not seeing big shifts in behavior at this point. And so, we'll see how that goes over the coming quarters. But -- but there's still a lot of uncertainty in the assumption set that you go through that you have here. And so, you got to make your best judgment on what you think is going to happen.\nBut as you get closer to the end of the right cycle, you've probably seen a lot of the mix shift and repricing happening already. And so, we'll see how that goes.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nCan I just add even just more broadly, just to be clear about, we don't -- we're not looking specifically at giving guidance in terms of 2024 yet. But at the same time, just more broadly speaking, we are and have been out earning an NII. And we've been very clear about that as we talk about getting toward our 15% ROTCE targets. It's in a more normalized environment.\nBut at the same time, there are a series of things that we expect to be able to do as we look forward. A big part of it is growing the fees in the business, as Mike spoke about. We're not constrained by the asset cap. They're in our existing businesses and a lot of the things that we're doing, whether it's in our wealth business, whether it's in the card business, whether it's in the corporate investment bank, or middle market as well.\nWe do expect to see the fruits of that labor. At the same time, we continue to stay very focused on expenses. And then, the other thing I would just remind everyone is there's lots of conversations around charge-offs and things like that. But remember, we are all required when we think about CECL to be as forward-looking as we possibly can.\nYou all know how we come up with the different scenarios. And so, the level of reserving that's been running through our P&L, I think this is the fifth consecutive quarter we've added to reserves, which is what's impacting the EPS of the company, has been based upon an environment which, at some point, will be very different than what the expectation is sitting here. So, I think to add all those things together, and I just think it's important to think about all those things as opposed to just NII itself. Next question, operator.\nOperator\nCertainly. We'll move on to Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nJust two follow-ups. One on the reserve build in commercial real estate that I know you discussed a bit already. I just wanted to understand how much of that was coming from really California. We all know there was a property that traded on California Street that sold at a discount.\nSo, I'm just wondering how much of it is California office versus anything more broader based beyond that? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Betsy. It's not isolated to California. I mean, I think you see weakness in a lot of cities these days, and it really comes down to property-specific stuff. And even in California, we've got as many examples where clients are actually reinvesting in buildings, even if lease rates are low or even empty in some cases, as they are going into it a workout.\nSo, I think it really depends on building borrower and all the things we sort of talked about in the script, and it's less focused on just California.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes. And I just want to reemphasize what Mike is saying, and we talked about this in the prepared remarks, which is we have all spent a bunch of time going through a very detailed review of the office portfolio. Just the other day, we went through just a whole series of things that we're seeing. And I just really want to make the point, which I said in my script, it's not -- there's -- it's a very big mistake to think about loss content by looking at just where the property is.\nAgain, we have examples in cities that are struggling where the structure of our loan is quite good. The underlying property has very high lease rates for an extended period of time. And then, we can have a loan in a market which is doing well. But for whatever reason that property is a specific issue in that property, there are a bunch of potential termination dates in the shorter term.\nAnd so, that's the level of detail that we've used to look at to come up with what we think the appropriate level of reserving is. And I think we've tried to be as diligent as we can in stressing the scenarios that we see play itself out, so that when we look at ourselves and we understand what CECL reserving requires us to do, that's what we're trying to accomplish.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nSo, would you -- and I think we all know like for the most part, commercial real estate loans are bullets, right, where the stress comes at the role. And I guess I'm wondering, is this reserve add reflecting the entirety of the CRE book for that entirety of roll rate risk? Or is this like a two-year forward? And part of the reason for asking the question is trying to understand if there's -- how much risk there is for further increases in CRE-related reserve builds?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Mike, I'll start, and then you either chime in or give your opinion. We have tried to take into account all of the risks including refinance risk that exists in the portfolios, looking at the current rate environment, cap rate expectations and things like that. Is it possible that we have to add something in the future because we learn more as time goes on, we would never say no? But again, what we're trying to do is be holistic in the review of the portfolio based upon everything that we know.\nAnd just as you can imagine, when we sit in the room with the people that run the real estate business and all the risk people, there's a range of opinion. There are people in there that say, we just -- it's hard to see losing this amount of money based upon what that individual thinks all of the underlying assumptions will play themselves out as. And then, there are others where we say we actually want to stress the scenario because it is possible, and we have to give a weighting to that. And -- so that's how we come up with what this is.\nBut again, we're trying to -- again, I don't have -- just -- we're trying to be forward-looking. We're trying to be holistic in all the risks that exist. And part of the reason to show you those -- that additional disclosure we made is so you can see exactly where the issues are relative to the rest of the office portfolio and the rest of the CRE and isolate just the level of reserving that exists, which is, at this point, is substantial.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. I understand. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, guys. Mike, can you share with us, you touched on this a little bit in response to one of the earlier questions. But when you guys are looking at your balance sheet and you're measuring your treasury functions on your assets and liabilities, can you share with us what you're thinking for the second half of the year or into next year in terms of how you're managing that? And how that may be different than what -- how you position the balance sheet a year ago.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Gerard. Sure. It's not that different, right? On the margin, you may be making decisions to add a little duration here or there, but I'd say it's marginal at this point. And we really haven't changed substantially how the balance sheet is positioned.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. And then, just a follow-up. I know you guys have given some good details here on working through the commercial real estate portfolio. And, Mike, I think you said in your prepared remarks in some cases, you've been able to get additional payments or equity investments from your borrowers to cure maybe a potential problem.\nCan you share with us some of the other workout solutions you're using so you can get through this period of adjustment that we're seeing in commercial real estate?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, sure. It's -- there's plenty of little structural enhancements you can make to feel better about it. And then there are also in a lot of cases, getting some partial paydowns.\nAnd then, you look at and you're trading those for refinancing in term. And I think you give people a little bit more time to work through these sets of issues. I think we try really hard not to punt issues down the road. And so, if there are real issues that we need to deal with, we try to deal with them in a moment.\nBut there are a number of structural enhancements that we sort of work on with borrowers to get ourselves comfortable that we're setting the loan up for success.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question on how you're interpreting the OCC and Fed joint statement that they put out on June 29th, encouraging lenders to find short-term or temporary loan accommodation solutions for their borrowers. Is that really anything new? Is that just standard operating procedure that they're reiterating? Or can this sort of help provide solutions that would allow you to work with your borrowers and perhaps delay classification, deterioration of classification or classification to TDR?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, it's Mike. I'll take that. Well, TDR doesn't exist anymore, but that classification. But the guidance is very similar to what was issued originally back, I think in 2009, hasn't really changed much and doesn't really change the way we've been interacting with our borrowers already in terms of really being proactive to work with them to find solutions to help them work through what could be difficult circumstances in some cases.\nSo, -- and it doesn't give you any leeway for how you classify criticized loans or other classification. So, the intent is really to just be clear that people should continue to work with borrowers to find solutions, which is what we do all the time anyway.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. And just a follow-up question here. Thank you for the disclosure again on Slide 6. With 22 billion of your loans in CIB, I think investors are wondering what is the average loan size there?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I don't think that's something we give. And it's a wide range. Averages sometimes are very misleading.\nAnd so there's a wide range. And what really matters is not the loan size. It really matters -- it will merely matters for all the variables Charlie talked about earlier in terms of what's happening with that property. So, I think that would be -- I think I would focus there.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. And just squeezing in one more question. And before I ask this expense question, Charlie, I think your investors very much appreciate it that you're not just doing whatever you can to hit an expense number, and you're reinvesting back into the company. So, to that end, I'm wondering if -- have you disclosed how much of the 800 million increase in the outlook for this year has to do with the severance?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWe didn't give an exact number, but that is, by far, the single largest piece of it, that's part of it. And there's some other exit costs for properties as we exit some lease space and other things. But that -- the severance is by far the largest piece.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you. \nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. I want to follow up, Charlie, on some of your prepared remarks. You talked about there's still some things that you're implementing to address regulatory issues. And wondering if you could give a couple of examples of what still needs to be done in terms of implementation and when you expect that to be completed.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nListen, I think as we've said, there's a lot of work to do. It is multiyears worth of deliverables. What we've -- what I've said is that we have implemented a lot, but we still have more to do. And I -- but I say that I just want to be clear, I'm speaking in -- everyone generally thinks I'm speaking about one of the consent orders, which has the asset cap.\nWe're thinking about all of the work that we have to do related to all the consent orders and the work to build the control environment. And there is a lot getting done. But ultimately, what matters, you don't get an A for effort, in this. It's about getting things over the finish line on time and getting them done to the -- with the quality that our regulators and we expect from each other.\nAnd so -- as you know, we've been very careful not to put dates out there because we have to do our work and then our regulators have to take a look at it and see if it's done to their satisfaction. We don't want to get ahead of that process, but we continue to move forward.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nAnd I understand that you can't speak for them signing off on what you've done. But in terms of you accomplishing what you want to accomplish, where are you on that kind of process like whether you want to frame it from an innings perspective or a percent basis. Any way to frame that acknowledging there's a lot to do and that you've done a lot, but how far along are you in terms of what you can control on implementing your things?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. No, listen, I appreciate the -- your desire to have me answer those questions. But again, all that matter, it does -- our view of accomplishing the work doesn't matter. What matters is that our regulators look at it and save them to their satisfaction.\nSo, I really don't think it's helpful or productive to go beyond what I've said at this point. But again, I do understand and appreciate why you're asking.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Fair enough. Thank you.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Vivek Juneja of JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks. A quick one. Mike or Charlie, can you give us the maturity schedule, what percentage or amount of your office CRE loans are maturing in the second half and into 2024?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nNot specifically, Vivek. We don't disclose that, but you should assume these are standard course loans in the commercial real estate space, which are generally three- to five-year loans.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nOK. And you haven't really been originating much in the last couple of years. So, I guess we could go back to looking at when did you slow down the origination of new office CRE, Mike? Was it two years ago? Was it three? Any color on that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Look, I think you have to remember that we've been refinancing existing facilities along that time period. So, -- but I think if you take the portfolio and assume some kind of basic average life based on what I said, I think you'll get a pretty good sense of the approximate maturity schedule.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nOK. And how about multifamily? What's the average life of those loans and maturities there? I recognize your comment -- I heard your comments that those are in a much better position given all the factors you already cited.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSlightly longer -- a few years longer than office.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nOK. All right. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd our final question for today's call will come from Charles Peabody of Portales Partners. Your line is open, sir.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nGood morning. Most of my questions were already asked and answered. But just I wanted to follow up on the consent order issues. If I recall correctly, and please correct me if I'm wrong, there's six consent orders remaining and three of them I remember, deals somewhat with the mortgage banking operation.\nAnd I know starting last fall, you started the planning effort to simplify and downsize that. And you've been executing on that this year. Can you give us a sense of what it is you need to do in mortgage banking related to those consent orders?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, sure. It's Mike. So, first of all, there are nine public consent orders out there that are all there, so you can see those. The -- when you look at the mortgage ones, I think that each of the consent orders is actually quite clear in terms of what needs to happen to satisfy those.\nSo, I would just point you back to the documents themselves, which can give you a pretty good sense of what it is, and each one is a little bit different.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nFollow-up then. Do you talk to the regulators about the progress you're making in mortgage banking on a monthly basis or quarterly basis semiannual? Or do you present something at the end? How does the interaction with regulators go?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWe talk to our regulators all the time at all parts of the company at all levels of the company. And so, you should assume we're actively engaged consistently with our regulators all the time. But the only thing I would add to that is -- but again, they're here, they're on site. We talk to them literally all the time.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nRight. No, I understand that. But specifically related to the progress you're making.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nI know. Just give me a second. We talk to them about everything. And given the importance of the consent orders, you can assume it's about the work that's going on in the underlying consent order.\nBut having said all of that, what matters is the work that they do at the end of the consent order after we submitted to them. And so, they can be up to speed on what we're doing. They can know how we feel about the progress that we're making. But at the -- but when we submit a consent order to them, they come in and do their holistic review.\nAnd so, that's really where their determination is made about whether or not it's done to their satisfaction. So, again, that just gets to the reason why I want to be very careful about not drawing any conclusions from our view on our work or any interim comments we might get from them. What really matters is the holistic review that they do and the process that they go through internally in the regulatory organizations.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nSo, that was part of my first question. Have you submitted anything yet on mortgage banking?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWe're not going to talk about that. I've said that over and over and over again.\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst\nThank you.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK. Thank you very much, everyone. We appreciate the time, and we'll talk to you all soon.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nCharles Peabody -- Portales Partners -- Analyst"}
{"date": "Oct 13, 2023, 10:00 a.m. ET", "exchange": "NYSE: WFC", "q": "2023-Q3", "ticker": "WFC", "transcript": "Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nWelcome and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo third quarter 2023 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss third quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our third quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financials referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks very much, John. I'll make some brief comments about our third quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review third quarter results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some third quarter highlights.\nOur results reflected the progress we're making to improve our financial performance. Revenue, pre-tax provision profit, net income, diluted earnings per common share, and ROTCE were all higher than a year ago. Our revenue reflected strong net interest income growth, as well as higher noninterest income, as we benefited from higher rates and the investments we're making in our businesses. Our expenses declined from a year ago due to lower operating losses.\nAs expected, net charge-offs have continued to increase from historical low levels, and we increased our allowance for credit losses, primarily driven by our office portfolio, as well as growth in our credit card portfolio. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the second quarter as higher rates and a slowing economy have weakened loan demand, and we've continued to take some credit-tightening actions. Average deposits also declined from the second quarter and a year ago, driven by consumer spending, as well as customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives. Consumer spending remains strong with third quarter year-over-year growth rates for both credit and debit card spending increasing from the second quarter.\nNow let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with risk and control work, which remains our top priority. As time goes on, we continue to make the progress necessary to complete our work. I've said that we have detailed project plans which track interim deliverables, not just the date the work is to be finalized and turned over to the regulators for validation. The work is not finalized all at once.\nIt's not as if there's a big bang conversion at the conclusion of a big body of work. It's just the opposite. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous, ongoing effort. We are implementing changes throughout the life of the project, and we track effectiveness along the way.\nThe numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment, but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. We remain focused on the work ahead, even as we are making progress. But I will repeat what I've said in the past: regulatory pressure on banks with long-standing issues, such as ours, continues to grow. And until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions.\nAdditionally, until our work is complete, we could find new issues that need to be remediated, and these may result in additional regulatory actions. We also continued to take steps to advance our business strategy, which includes focusing on our core business and customers. We sold approximately $2 billion of private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We are also making a number of investments to better serve our customers.\nAs a leader in U.S. middle-market and asset-based lending, we're focused on finding ways to support our clients with the recently announced strategic relationship with Centerbridge Partners. Our middle-market clients will have greater access to alternative sources of capital that can be used to pursue a broader set of growth and value-creation initiatives across a variety of market conditions. Branches continue to play an important role in the way we serve our customers, and we continue to optimize our network, but we also look at targeted expansions in markets where we see opportunities for our franchise.\nLast week, we announced we are expanding our branch network in Chicago, where we only have seven branches today. We also continue to make enhancements to our mobile app. And in the third quarter, we launched Stock Fractions, giving WellsTrade clients the ability to buy fractions of companies' stocks to help build a diversified portfolio, regardless of stock price. Just yesterday, we announced the expanded availability of LifeSync to all consumer customers.\nAvailable on the mobile app, LifeSync is our personalized digital approach to aligning customers' goals with their money and was launched to all wealth and investment management clients earlier this year. Customers' goals entered in LifeSync will be visible to bankers to enhance needs-based conversations. We also expanded the capabilities of Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant, and recently added the ability for customers to communicate with Fargo in Spanish. These enhanced capabilities are just the latest of our ongoing investments to deliver seamless and consistent experiences across all our channels.\nWe are seeing more mobile adoption momentum, adding over 520,000 mobile active users in the third quarter, our best quarterly growth since first quarter of 2021. We've also continued to make important hires who bring expertise to Wells Fargo and businesses we're looking to grow. Before I highlight some of our new leaders, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Bill Daley, vice chairman of public affairs who's retiring at the end of this year, for all he has accomplished since he joined the company in 2019. Bill has been an invaluable asset to the company, and we benefited from his long experience in both the public and private sectors.\nDuring his time at Wells Fargo, he helped strengthen our relationships with communities we serve, established new programs in housing and small business, and worked to rebuild our reputation, both locally and nationally. I'm pleased to have announced that Tom Nides joined Wells Fargo as vice chairman earlier this month. Tom will be a close advisor to the senior management team on a range of issues, and he will work alongside our business leaders as we continue to expand our relationships with clients. The breadth of Tom's experience across the public and private sectors will be an important asset to us as we continue to move the company ahead.\nWe continue to invest in our corporate investment banking business with new co-heads of equity capital markets. These new hires complement the other important hires we've been making over the past year. We also hired a new head of trust services and chief fiduciary officer in our wealth and investment management segment and a new head of affluent and premier banking in consumer, small, and business banking. We also continued to focus on better serving our communities.\nDuring the third quarter, we published three reports that provide an overview of the work we are doing to build a sustainable, inclusive future in the communities we serve; outline our strategic approach to managing the risks associated with climate change in deploying capital to support the transition to a low-carbon economy; and describe our methodology for aligning our financial portfolios with pathways to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 and presenting interim emissions-based targets to track that alignment. We continue to make progress on our special-purpose credit program initiative we announced last year to help drive economic growth, sustainable homeownership, and neighborhood stability in minority communities. We recently expanded our special-purpose refinance offers to prequalified Hispanic customers with Wells Fargo mortgages to refinance at a lower-than-market rate. The program launched last year for Black or African American customers has seen strong results, and the Hispanic offer has shown similar levels of customer engagement.\nWe also announced that we're offering a $10,000 homebuyer access grant that will be applied toward the down payment for eligible homebuyers who currently live in or are purchasing homes in certain underserved communities in eight metropolitan areas. And we now have 14 HOPE Inside centers Wells Fargo branches, including the first focusing on serving the Navajo community. These centers help engage and empower communities to achieve their financial goals through financial education workshops and free one-on-one coaching. Looking ahead, the U.S.\neconomy has continued to be resilient with key support from the labor and strength -- from the labor market and strength in consumer spending. Delinquencies have continued to deteriorate at a relatively slow, consistent rate without signs of acceleration across our portfolios. Our base case remains a continued slowing of the economy, but we remain prepared for a wide range of scenarios, given there is still significant uncertainty ahead. Regarding capital, the Basel 3 endgame proposal included higher capital requirements as we expected.\nIt's a complicated set of rules. But at this point, if nothing changed and we didn't take actions, we estimate that our RWA would increase by approximately 20%. There are some items that increased our capital requirements that we are hopeful will be adjusted, and we will be participating and sharing our perspectives on the proposed rules during the 120-day comment period. Additionally, we are evaluating changes we may make based on the proposed rules.\nFortunately, we come into this from a strong position as our current capital levels are above the estimated regulatory minimum, plus buffers. However, we still need to decide how much of an additional buffer we want to maintain and what mitigating actions we may want to take to reduce the impact of the new rules. At this point, we still see a path to concurrently increasing our level of CET1, as appropriate, increasing our dividend, and repurchasing common stock. Levels of each will be influenced by CCAR, the finalization of the proposed rules, and economic conditions.\nI'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the third quarter was $5.8 billion or $1.48 per diluted common share, both up from the second quarter and a year ago. Our third quarter results included $349 million or $0.09 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior-period tax matters. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 3.\nOur CET1 ratio increased to 11% in the third quarter, 2.1 percentage points above our new regulatory minimum, plus buffers, effective on October 1. This was up from 10.7% in the second quarter as higher earnings, the approximately 14-basis-point benefit from the sale of certain private equity investments, and lower risk-weighted assets were only partially offset by share repurchases and dividends. During the third quarter, we repurchased $1.5 billion in common stock. Our strong capital levels position us well for the anticipated increases related to the Basel 3 endgame proposal released in the third quarter.\nBased on where we ended the quarter, we estimate that our CET1 ratio would be 50 basis points above the fully phased-in required minimum if the proposed rules were implemented as written after factoring the growth in RWAs and the resulting decline in our stress capital buffer, as well as the impact of the new G-SIB buffer calculation changes. Importantly, this is an early estimate, subject to change, and is before any actions we may take to mitigate the impact of the new rules. Looking forward, we expect to continue to have capacity to increase our CET1 ratio, while we plan to continue to repurchase shares as we wait for the capital rules to be finalized. Turning to credit quality on Slide 5.\nAs we expected, net loan charge-offs continued to increase, up 4 basis points from the second quarter to 36 basis points of average loans. Commercial net loan charge-offs declined modestly from the second quarter to 13 basis points of average loans as lower losses in our commercial and industrial portfolio were partially offset by $14 million of higher losses in commercial real estate. We had $32.2 billion of office loans, down 3% from the second quarter, which represented 3% of our total loans outstanding. Vacancy rates continue to be high, and the office market remains weak.\nOur CRE teams continue to focus on monitoring and derisking the portfolio, which includes reducing exposures. As we highlighted in the past, each property situation is different and the remaining variables that could determine performance, which is why we regularly review this portfolio. As expected, consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up $98 million from the second quarter to 67 basis points of average loans. Residential mortgage loans continued to have net recoveries, while our other consumer portfolios all had higher losses with the largest increase in our auto portfolio, which was up from the second quarter seasonal lows.\nNonperforming assets increased 17% from the second quarter as growth in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans more than offset the decline in commercial and industrial, as well as modest declines across all consumer portfolios. The decline in commercial industrial nonaccrual loans was primarily due to payoffs and paydowns, which is a good reminder that the resolution of nonperforming assets doesn't always result in charge-offs. The increase in commercial real estate nonaccrual loans was driven by a $1.3 billion increase in the office nonaccrual loan. Moving to Slide 6.\nOur allowance for credit losses increased $333 million in the third quarter, primarily for commercial real estate office loans, as well as for higher credit card loan balances, which was partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. Since the composition of our office portfolio is relatively consistent with what we shared with you in the past few quarters, we did not include a separate commercial real estate slide this quarter. However, we did update the table, showing the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. We had not seen significant increases in charge-offs in our commercial real estate office portfolio yet.\nHowever, we do expect higher losses over time, and we continue to increase the coverage ratio in our commercial -- in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio from 8.8% at the end of the second quarter to 10.8% at the end of the third quarter. On Slide 7, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down modestly from both the second quarter and a year ago. While we continue to have good growth in credit card loans from the second quarter, most other portfolios declined.\nI'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 195 basis points from a year ago and 24 basis points from the second quarter due to the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 5% from a year ago, predominantly driven by deposit outflows in our consumer and wealth businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. Average deposits also declined in commercial banking, while they stabilized in corporate and investment banking.\nAs expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase, up 23 basis points from the second quarter of 236 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. However, the pace of the increase has slowed, and our percentage of average noninterest-bearing deposits decreased modestly from the second quarter to 29% but remained above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to net interest income on Slide 8. Third quarter net interest income was $13.1 billion, up 8% from a year ago, as we continued to benefit from the impact of higher rates.\nThe $58 million decline from the second quarter was due to lower average deposit balances, partially offset by one additional day in the quarter and the impact of higher interest rates. Last quarter, we increased our expectations for full-year 2023 net interest income growth to approximately 14% compared with 2022, which was up from our expectation of 10% growth at the beginning of the year. We now expect full-year 2023 net interest income growth to grow by approximately 16% compared with 2022 with the fourth quarter 2023 net interest income expected to be approximately $12.7 billion. The expected decline in interest income in the fourth quarter was primarily driven by our assumptions for additional deposit outflows and migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits, as well as continued deposit repricing, including continued competitive pricing on commercial deposits.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 9. Noninterest expense declined from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses, and increased 1% from the second quarter, driven by higher operating losses, severance expense, and revenue-related comp. Last quarter, we updated our expectations for full-year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses, to approximately $51 billion. We now expect it to be approximately $51.5 billion or approximately $12.6 billion in the fourth quarter.\nThe increase reflects additional severance and other one-time costs, revenue-related compensation, and some lags in realizing efficiency saves. We've reduced headcount every quarter since the third quarter of 2020 and was down 3% from the second quarter and 5% from a year ago. We believe we still have additional opportunities to reduce headcount, and attrition has remained low which will likely result in additional severance expense for actions in 2024. We are working through our efficiency plans now as part of the budget process.\nAdditionally, if the FDIC deposit special assessment related to the events from earlier in the year is finalized in the fourth quarter, it would increase our expected fourth quarter expenses. And finally, as a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating results. Turning to our operating segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 10. Consumer, small, and business banking revenue increased 7% from a year ago as higher net interest income, driven by the impact of higher interest rates, was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees, driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year.\nCharlie highlighted the investments we were making in our Chicago branch network, and we're also making investments in refurbishing branches across our existing network. Additionally, we are bringing our digital onboarding experience to our branches, creating a fast and easy experience for our customers. At the same time, we've reduced our total number of branches by 6% from a year ago. Home lending revenue declined 14% from a year ago due to a decline in mortgage banking income, driven by lower originations in servicing income, which included the impact of sales of mortgage servicing rights.\nWe continue to reduce headcount in home lending in the third quarter, down 37% from a year ago, and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline. Credit card revenue increased 2% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by introductory promotional rates and higher credit card rewards expense. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above pre-pandemic levels. New account growth continued to be strong, up 22% from a year ago, reflecting the continued success of our new products and increased marketing.\nImportantly, the quality of the new accounts continued to be better than what we were booking historically. While the majority of new cards were to existing Wells Fargo customers, we're increasingly attracting more customers that are new to Wells Fargo. Auto revenue declined 15% from a year ago, driven by continued loan spread compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue is up 14% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 18% in the second quarter. We continue to make progress on the strategic plans we announced earlier this year, including focusing on serving Wells Fargo Bank customers, as well as borrowers in minority communities. We did not originate or fund any correspondent mortgages in the third quarter.\nThe size of our auto portfolio has declined for six consecutive quarters, and balances were down 9% at the end of the third quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volumes declined 24% from a year ago, reflecting credit-tightening actions, as well as continued price competition. Our origination mix continue to shift toward higher FICO scores, reflecting the credit-tightening actions we've taken over the past year. Debit card spend increased 2% from a year ago with growth in most categories, offsetting declines in fuel, home improvement, and travel.\nCredit card spending continued to be strong and was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew from a year ago, including fuel, which rebounded after declining in the second quarter. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 12. Middle-market banking revenue increased 23% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances.\nAsset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 3% year over year due to higher loan balances, as well as higher revenue from renewable energy investments. Loan balances were up 7% in the third quarter compared to a year ago, driven by growth in asset-based line leasing. Average loans were down 1% in the second quarter due to declines in middle-market banking. After increasing the first half of the year, revolver utilization rates declined in the third quarter to levels similar to a year ago.\nTurning to corporate investment banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 20% from a year ago, driven by higher lending revenue, stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, and higher investment banking revenue, reflecting increased activity across all products. As Charlie highlighted, we've continued to hire experienced bankers, helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well when markets improve. Commercial real estate revenue grew 14% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates and higher revenue in our low-income housing business, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances.\nMarkets revenue increased 33% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue in structured products, equities, credit products, and foreign exchange. We've had strong trading results for three consecutive quarters as we benefited from market volatility and the investments we've made in technology and talent to grow this business. Average loans were down 5% from a year ago, driven by banking, reflecting a combination of slower demand, payoffs, and modestly lower line utilization. Average loan balances were stable with the second quarter.\nOn Slide 14, wealth and investment management revenue increased 1% compared to a year ago, driven by higher asset-based fees due to the increased market valuations. Net interest income declined from a year ago, driven by lower deposit balances as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives, as well as lower loan balances. While average deposits were down compared to both the second quarter and a year ago, the pace of the decline slowed in the third quarter. As a reminder, the majority of WIM, wealth and investment management, advisory assets were priced at the beginning of the quarter, so third quarter results reflected market valuations as of July 1, which were higher from a year ago.\nAsset-based fees in the fourth quarter will reflect market valuations as of October 1, which were also higher from a year ago but were lower from the third quarter pricing date. Average loans were down 4% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in securities-based lending. Slide 15 highlights our corporate results. This segment includes venture capital and private equity investments, including the investments and funds that we sold in the third quarter.\nThe sale had a nominal impact on third quarter net income. Revenue declined $345 million from a year ago, reflecting assumption changes related to the valuation of our Visa B common stock exposure, as well as lower venture capital revenue. In summary, our results in the third quarter reflected continued improvement in our financial performance. During the first nine months of this year, we had strong growth in revenue, pre-tax provision profit, and diluted earnings per share compared to a year ago.\nAs expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase from historical lows, and we increased our allowance for credit losses by over $1.9 billion this year, primarily for CRE office loans and higher credit for loan balances. We are closely monitoring our portfolios and taking credit-tightening actions where we believe appropriate. Our capital levels have increased, and we expect to continue to return excess capital to shareholders. We will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator instructions] And we will take our first question from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. I wanted to ask about the expenses, Mike. Obviously, improving efficiency has been a big goal of yours.\nYou made progress, even while investing in regulatory. What are the additional opportunities to improve efficiency from here as you head into 2024? I know you're probably not ready to give guidance for '24 yet, but are you going into the budget planning with a mindset that they should be roughly flattish? Any comments you can give on that would be helpful. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Sure. Thanks, John. First off, let's just make sure we keep it all in context, right? We set out a program almost three years ago now to cut roughly $10 billion, and I think that's all still on track.\nWe've brought headcount down 40,000 from -- or closer to 50,000 from the peak back in 2025, so sort of very good progress to date. And I think as Charlie and I have both said over the last couple of quarters, we still have more to do to make it more efficient, and I would say there are very few parts of the company that we would say are optimized at this point. Now some have more opportunity than others, some require investment in terms of automation and technology, some don't. But I do think that we go into the budget process and even just how we operate every quarter with a very disciplined approach to every single area of the company, saying what are we going to do to continue to drive more efficiency there while we make investments as well, and we highlighted some of those that we've been making on in the prepared remarks.\nBut I think it's the same mindset we've been bringing to it now for the last few years, and I think we're going to continue to do that. Where that ultimately ends up, we'll share for next year. We'll share with you in January, like we always do.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Fair enough. And then on the net interest income outlook for the fourth quarter, are you building in assumptions -- you mentioned deposit outflows and mix shift assumptions. Are they assuming that things accelerate from here or similar to what you've seen this quarter? It seems like a pretty big sequential decline.\nJust kind of wondering what some of the assumptions are there. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No, look, I think as you can -- as we've talked about over the last  - what feels like forever, but certainly last four, five, six quarters now, there's still a lot of uncertainty out there in terms of how the path of both the deposits and pricing will shape up, whether it's all the quantitative tightening, all of the -- any competitive reactions we may see from others. And so I think we continue to think that we're going to see these trends appear at some point. Now we've been pleasantly surprised this -- to date this year that it hasn't progressed as fast as we thought it would.\nBut at some point, it will. And so hopefully, we'll find ourselves in a position where it doesn't move as maybe fast as we've modeled in terms of pricing. But we still -- all those trends are going to happen and are happening. As you look at shifts between noninterest bearing and interest bearing, you're seeing deposit costs continue to increase.\nAnd on the consumer side, you see people spending their money. And so exactly at what pace those things are all going to keep going as we certainly modeled it, but we try to give you a base case forecast that we can hit under a bunch of different scenarios, and this is the same.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Got it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. So wanted to start, Charlie, because you had made some comments about capital targets and those potentially evolving. The inflation RWA from Basel 3 endgame that you guided to does bring your CET1 minimum to 8.5%. You alluded subtly, mind you, to the possibility of managing to a lower target.\nSince 150 bps management cushion does feel excessive, what are some of the factors that would compel you to maintain a larger cushion than peers and maybe continue to run at or above 10%?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, let me just -- I'll start, and then I'll hand it over to Mike. We were not trying to -- or I was not trying to give any direction about where we thought the appropriate buffer would be. We're just trying to be very factual about where we are. And once everything is finalized, we'll determine what the right buffers are, and we'll communicate those.\nSo please don't try and read any more into what I said, other than just that.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And I think, Steve, I know your estimate might be 150 basis points, but I think what we've talked about over time is that, at least at this point, we've been saying our buffer is probably closer to 100% -- 100 basis points over wherever the right minimum might be. And that may evolve, as Charlie said. I think as you look at Basel 3, the increase in RWA is driven by the things that are probably pretty obvious, whether it's operational risk, plus the -- some of the other factors.\nBut operational risk is certainly going to be one of the bigger pieces of it. And so I really do think that we have to see how the final rule shakes out next year. We're hopeful that there'll be some changes to areas that we think just makes sense from aligning sort of the capital requirements to the risk while also maybe moderating some of the operational risk increases as well, and so we're going to engage as we go there. But one of the factors that we've talked about now for a while in terms of how big our buffer should be is that we needed the rules to be finalized.\nAnd so could that lead you to having a slightly smaller buffer than what we would have had in the past? Potentially. But I think we have to get there and get these finalized, and then we'll also take actions once we have good clarity on what's going to change or not change as we go over the next year. So I mean, we're probably nine months to 12 months away from getting a final rule, and so we still have a little bit of time for this to play out.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThanks for the color. And, Mike, for a follow-up, just on the trading business. It continues to surprise positively versus expectations. You cited some of the investments that you've made, the benefits of volatility.\nBut with revenues running multiples above what we've seen in prior years and that $1 billion-plus bogey being reached for three consecutive quarters, I was hoping you could just speak to whether we should be underwriting $1 billion-plus as a new normal or if there were any cyclical benefits or anomalous benefits that maybe we shouldn't be underwriting go forward. Just trying to think about what the normalized level of trading revenue should be, given some of the investments you've made scaling of that business.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I'll take that. Look, I think we've -- as you said, we've just been methodically investing in the capabilities with a focus on supporting our core clients more than -- more -- with more capabilities versus like trying to expand the scope of what we do in a way that just doesn't fit who we are. And so I think that's what you've seen us try to do there in those businesses. So businesses like FX and rates just  - is sort of methodically sort of adding people in a couple of slots or improving technology.\nAnd we've certainly been the benefit of some volatility in the market this year. So as you know, that could change pretty quickly one way or the other. But I think as we look at some of these businesses, what we're focused on is just adding more clients, more flows, more -- incrementally each month and each quarter. And so whether it ends up being $1 billion, plus or minus a quarter -- per quarter, I think we'll see as we go, but we're pretty pleased with what we've seen so far.\nAnd there isn't a big one-time event that happened in the quarter that drove the results, and so that's good to see as well. And you're also not seeing big growth in market risk RWA as we do this as well, and so that's part of what we've been trying to do as well is kind of sweat the balance sheet more and make sure that we're getting paid for the exposure and the risk we've got there. And so we're happy to see that it's starting to come together. And we're under no illusions, though, that three quarters is like success, right? We've got to do this over a long period of time and continue to add capabilities and clients.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThat's great.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping maybe, Mike, you could spend another moment sort of discussing RWA mitigation in light of the fed capital proposals. I guess, specifically, I was hoping for maybe a little more color.\nI know you touched on it in some of the earlier remarks but the sale of the $2 billion in private equity. And then maybe if you could also discuss the new agreement with Centerbridge for direct lending, just sort of how all these factor into your thinking here.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. When you look at mitigation -- I'll just give you some examples of the types of things we're thinking about. So when you look at securities finance transactions, you have haircut -- collateral haircut floors that get implemented. And I don't want to get too technical on it because -- but there's some technical requirements there that just don't seem to make sense to us.\nAnd so -- but if they do get implemented as written, we'll adapt, and we'll change the way we -- what collateral we require from clients to do trades, or we'll reprice them. And so there'll be a number of things that we can do like on transactions like that, but it gets very, very technical for each of the underlying deals. There will be -- I know others have talked about this, too. We'll have to decide how much tax equity investing we do in renewables.\nIf the risk weights hold there, it's just -- the math just doesn't make sense from a return perspective, and so we'll probably have to do less -- we'll probably do less of those. And so there's a number of things like that as you go through each of the underlying portfolios just don't make sense, and we're going to -- we'll make the adjustments as we need to. Now we're also in a position where we've got plenty of flexibility as we talked about in the prepared remarks, right? Our capital levels today are there with a buffer already, and so we have the flexibility to handle it however we think makes sense to -- for each of the underlying businesses. And what we want to make sure we do is like we're building real businesses and client relationships over a long period of time, so it's not about necessarily walking away from clients.\nIt's about finding ways to serve them in ways that both makes sense for them and from a return perspective for us. But it's going to be a very, very granular conversation. Some of it will be repricing. You got 364-day revolvers that will need to be repriced.\nYou've got -- there's a whole bunch of very technical things like that that will get done over time once the rule is finalized. Switching to the partnership we have with Centerbridge, look, it's a -- we have been getting demand from clients for a while now in the middle-market, kind of mid-corporate space for solutions to help them in financing that they need where it likely wouldn't make sense for us to put on our balance sheet anyway. And so instead of having -- telling clients we can't help them or having them go direct to somebody else, we built a partnership with Centerbridge that allows us to remain an advisor to a client and help them solve a problem they may have. And so that's the way we're thinking about it.\nAnd we're excited to work with Centerbridge and that team, and they're a very high-quality team, have done a lot over time. And I think this gives us another arrow in the quiver to help us provide solutions for clients. And so it's early, and it will grow over time, hopefully. And hopefully, clients will see it in the same way.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK. Perfect. Thank you. And then maybe as a follow-up, might want to revisit -- or I was hoping to revisit the NII discussion for a bit.\nI certainly appreciate all the comments on continuing mix shift and deposit pricing pressure. But I guess, as we get to this level at the end of the year, is the thought that there would still be on-balance downward pressure on NII beyond that? Or is -- as you see it, is there enough kind of asset repricing opportunity that would ultimately allow things to settle out maybe sooner as opposed to later?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, we'll see. I think we do need to wait until we get toward the end of the year and into January for us to give you a real view on 2024. I mean, I think what the last number of quarters have -- just show over and over and over that there's a lot still to play out here.\nAnd to get too far ahead of ourselves on it for next year, I think, would be a mistake at this point. So -- but look, the same -- it's the same drivers we've been talking about for a while, right? It's like what's going to happen with deposits, the mix, the pricing. And then to a lesser degree, right now, it's loan growth, but it still matters over a long period of time as well.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nYeah, OK. Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. Can you just elaborate on the comment of tightening the credit box a bit? And then, I guess, specifically in credit card, thoughts there? I know you've been leaning into it and have had real good growth. And I think it's still only about 5% of your loan book, but wondering your thoughts of -- is this really the right time to be leaning into credit card maybe as we're kind of later cycle?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I'll start with credit card and come back to the broader point. So we started on a journey to transform that -- the card business back in the fourth quarter of '19, so right after really Charlie started. And what we've done since then is really refreshed -- almost completely refreshed the product line.\nWe still have a little bit more to do there. And so part of what you're seeing come through in the results is actually putting out good products that people want to buy. And you're seeing really -- we have really good new account growth in the quarter, probably our best quarter in quite some time. And so it starts with just having a good product and good service behind it, and that's the key driver, I think, of what you're seeing here.\nOn the credit side on the new originations, the new accounts we're adding are really good relative to the back book. And when you look at both -- and even when you dig a little bit deeper there, there's -- the majority of them are still Wells Fargo Bank customers, but we're seeing more and more traction with non-Wells Fargo customers, so first-time customers. And when you look at those first-time-to-Wells customers, those -- the credit profile is really good. And so we feel comfortable with like the risks that's being added there, and we're going to continue to look for pockets of risk.\nAnd if we see them, we'll tighten it down. But in terms of what we're seeing in originations, we feel good about what we're seeing so far. Just more broadly on credit, we've said now for probably the last four or five quarters, we've been kind of incrementally tightening the credit box on the consumer side for a while. Whether it's really across the board, in home lending, auto, card, personal loans, really every single one of them had some credit tightening, and it's been a bit incremental over the last four or five quarters.\nAnd so I would still sort of think of that as like taking that last 1% or 2% or 3% of origination out that doesn't make sense in what could be a more difficult economic environment. It's not wholesale shifts in sort of the approach or the underlying box that we're operating in. It's really sort of modest and incremental. And then on the --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd just on -- and just to be clear, I mean, it's -- and it's the very basic stuff. It's just upping the lower FICO boundaries. It's layered risks. And so it's just as you continue to make these changes, you just -- we're just continuing to do the same types of things without just wholesale exits or anything like that.\nIt's just kind of a smart tightening.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And then outside the consumer space -- outside of consumer, really the only place that we've meaningfully tightened credit over the last couple of years or a few years is commercial real estate. And other than that, I think there's probably some minor tinkering, but we haven't really changed the appetite much outside of commercial real estate.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. That's helpful. And then just a clarification on the severance costs. Can you give us what the absolute amount was this quarter? I think you gave us the change versus a year ago and linked quarter.\nBut what was the absolute level this quarter?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, there wasn't a lot a year ago, so it's not far off of the total, so a small difference. But it's -- there wasn't a lot.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. So about $200 million?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And again, that will sort of evolve as we go. I've mentioned that in my script as we look at next year and the attrition rates that we're seeing.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nYeah. OK. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. On the commercial real estate front, I know you cited the increase in the office loan loss reserve from -- in the CIB from 8.8% to 10.8%. Could you just comment there in terms of what were some of the anecdotal drivers for the loan loss reserve increase? Do you think you could have incremental increases here? And maybe cite some of the office revaluations you've seen as you have seen, the underlying collateral change hands or reappraisals, if you can give us some color there as well. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, sure. When you -- the hard part of office right now is that there aren't a lot of trades happening yet, right? There's a few in certain cities, and they're all a little bit different in their complexion. So you still have somewhat limited information in price discovery in a lot of places. And so we're doing -- we do a lot of our own work to try to evaluate each of the underlying properties and what they could be worth in a bunch of different scenarios, and then it's feeling like the appraisal market is starting to kind of catch up, where they're -- we're seeing appraisals that are more realistic and more updated.\nSo that's certainly bringing in different data points as we look at it. And as we looked at the quarter, we sort of look at all those data points and the underlying loans and try to do our best to come up what we think the different range of loss could look like here, and that's what's embedded in the results. Hopefully, we end up being conservative. But nonetheless, it's possible that this plays out this way.\nAnd so we haven't really seen any losses of significant yet -- significance yet, but we will. And it just takes some time for it to play out for each of these underlying situations, probably longer than any of us would hope to -- you'd hope that you could bring some of this stuff to resolution maybe faster than it really takes in real life. But it's really looking at all the data points, the limited sales, the new appraisals that are coming through, and then our own analysis for each of the underlying properties.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. All right. Thanks, Mike. And then separately, also within commercial real estate, we're getting more and more questions around multifamily exposures and just how well they really are holding up given some supply issues in certain markets.\nCan you just comment there? Are you seeing any noteworthy stress or any changes to underlying reserve for that book?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, not a lot. I mean, you certainly see certain markets that might appear to have some oversupply in condos in certain places. But it feels like that will work itself out over a period of time. We're not seeing real systematic stress in the portfolio at this point.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. If I can ask just one last one. On the headcount cuts that you mentioned, you're looking at every business pretty much. Are any headcount cuts occurring yet in the risk area or anything? Or any changes with the contracts with consultants in the risk overhaul area at all? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No. Look, the only thing I'd say on the risk and rework is that we're going to spend whatever we need to spend and put the resources we need against it to get it done, and we're going to continue to do that toward --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nJust to be clear, like we're not cutting headcount related to that. In fact, it's probably the opposite when you look over the past bunch of quarters. The only thing which goes up and down is depending on where we are with work with outside consultants, that number will go up or down in a given quarter. But we've also said, if we can use outside resources to help get the work done sooner, we're going to.\nSo as we think about -- just as we think about our efficiencies, that is just not in scope at this point or for the foreseeable future.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGot it. All right. Thanks, Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. Of course.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. My first question is on the revenue side. As a follow-up to Chubak's line of questioning, I think not only the trading numbers come better this year but also investment banking.\nAnd so I hear you loud and clear about the cyclicality of the trading business. But I guess help us get a sense of -- if the industry wallet, for example, return to 2019 levels, do you think that you're going to have generally a higher share of revenues in capital markets versus 2019? And sort of the sub-question to that is, as we think about the investments you have already made, what are the other businesses that could potentially surprise us to the upside, where it's not quite optimized yet in terms of its revenue production? And obviously, everybody is thinking about -- you mentioned card, and also everybody is also thinking about wealth management and investment advisory revenues.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Well, let me take a shot at that. I think -- listen, I think the answer is, to your question on share, without getting overly specific, yes. We think when you look at where we stand on our growth in our corporate investment banking share, whether it's on the trading side or whether it's on the fee-related side, our shares have grown.\nAnd certainly, on the -- within the fee-based side of the business, we do hope they continue to grow. That's driven by the investments that we're making, and investments, meaning people in terms of growing our capabilities. And we've got clear goals and targets by person that we bring on in terms of what we expect, and we're going to be tracking to that. And just a reminder, certainly, when we brought some of the people on, they bring some -- a lot of clients with them, some new transactions in the short term.\nAnd we've been beneficiaries of that over the last couple of quarters, just as we brought some people on. But these are relationship-based businesses, and transactions don't occur every single quarter. So we would expect our share to continue to grow. And I just -- as a reminder, without taking any additional risk overall because we're taking the risk today relative to the exposures that we have.\nWhen we look at where we can see growth coming overall across the entire company, we just go business by business. Absolutely, in our consumer, small business -- small and business banking segment because we've basically been treading water there as we stabilized that business, going back to the issues that we had there, which was an incredibly difficult thing to do, and we did. And we've not been our -- we've not been on our front foot in that business. We're going to do it in a very different way than this company did it historically, but there are opportunities to be on the front foot and actually grow share on an organic basis.\nAnd so incredibly excited about that opportunity. Not excited, as I've said, about growing share in mortgage. That's not where we're after, and it's -- we've talked about where we're going there. Auto, it's about returns, not growth.\nSo don't look for a lot of growth there, unless the dynamics change in the business. Mike spoke about card. We're incredibly energized by the evidence that shows. With our brand and our relationships, when you put a great product out there, we get positive selection and real growth.\nAnd by the way, look at our spend numbers. I mean, if you want to see like the impact of what it means, just look at the spend that we're seeing, which is much higher than the industry levels. Our wealth business, as you pointed out, no question, also treaded water for a long period of time. We're attracting people and teams.\nWe're rolling out new products, so we feel really good about the opportunities that are there. And in the middle-market segment, where it's a little bit more business as usual because it is such a strong franchise for us. Even there, we look back at our asset-based lending businesses and the things that we acquired from GE. They ran as stand-alone businesses here for a long period of time.\nAnd we didn't bring the entire product set of Wells Fargo to those customer bases under Kyle Hranicky, Kristin Lesher, MK Duboise -- or Mary Katherine DuBose are diligently working through that and bringing the investment banking product to that entire commercial banking product. So I could go on. I just -- it should be broad-based. Most of it, by the way, I'll point out, in terms of when we see opportunities, it is fee-based growth, not because we've dictated that, but just because we focused a lot on NII as a company historically.\nAnd we just have a lot of opportunities that we get excited about that will play out over a period of time.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. And I think that excitement is clear, Charlie. And my second question is, given all of that and taking a step back, I totally think it's too early, I agree with you, to give anything on '24 expenses. But more broadly discussing, do you feel like the company is in a little bit of an inflection point? Because on one hand, Mike was saying that very few parts of the bank are optimized.\nOn the other, I think you guys mentioned that the headcount is not going the other way, and perhaps it's really some of the outside consulting fees that could go up and down. But I'm wondering if you get asked about expenses in a framework of flat, but then all of this momentum on the revenue side seems to be on the come, I'm wondering how you think about as you budget for the company and as you think about just getting to that 15% ROTCE, let's just put Basel 3 endgame aside in terms of the denominator, how do you balance some of the shareholders and the analysts that are asking you about expenses in the context of flat versus the revenue momentum that obviously would need expenses to keep sustaining versus that revenue momentum that you seem to be so excited about?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nLet me start. And, Mike, you either come in at the end or just make your comments along the way as well. So I think, first of all, we think about it as two separate exercises that we go through. And we're -- and it's very timely because we're in the middle of going through the exercise for next year, as most other companies are, which is this company is not efficient, like period, end of story.\nAnd I've described this. It's even with all of the reductions that we've made, it's not surprising because as you peel the onion back, other things present themselves. And so you go in order of things that are more obvious and things like that. But when we sit around as a management team, we feel great about the progress.\nAnd there's no clearer way to see that than in the headcount numbers, which ultimately drive the expense of the company. And if I -- if we stood here and told you we were going to drive the headcount down that much in this period of time, I'm not sure you'd have believed us. And so when we say we're going to do something, we really do mean it. And so when we sit around as a team, there are many more efficiencies to get, and we're diligently working through those.\nAnd then separately from that, it's when we talk about making investments into place, are we getting the payoff for it? And so whether it's the marketing in the card business, where we're spending more money on marketing than we had in the past, and we feel great about, as Mike pointed out, not just the volumes that we're getting but the underlying quality relative to how we had modeled that. And so we'll do that with each and everything. And ultimately, we need to make a decision as we finalize the process of the budget on just much more of a tactical basis of how those things net out. We're well aware of what shareholders are looking for.\nWe're well aware of that the expense side of this company is an important equation in what investors look at us in terms of where -- unlocking value, and we hear it, and we see it. And whatever -- wherever we come out when we talk to you about our guidance for next year, we will explain why we got to where we are. It's going to include efficiencies. It's going to include investments.\nWhether it -- where that turns out, we'll explain it. And I think so far, we've been as clear and as transparent as we can be. And if it makes sense, you'll like it. And if it doesn't, you won't, you'll tell us.\nBut so far, we've been able to have alignment there. But overall, I would just -- it's a long way of saying it's not lost on us that we have opportunities, both to reduce expenses and to invest. But making sure that the overall expense level stays in check at this place is incredibly important to us, and we have to prove that there is revenue growth there supporting investments that we make.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nThank you for that.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. Just, Mike, for you, a follow-up on credit on the C&I side, nonaccrual charge-offs staying relatively flat, I guess, as we look through. Just talk to us in terms of when you look at that C&I book, is the impact of the fed rate hikes felt by your customers? And how are you seeing that evolve? Is your expectation right now -- you talked about the economy being resilient. Are you seeing any soft spots on the C&I book where you're seeing bankruptcies rise within a vertical or a certain segment?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No. Look, I think, first, you're seeing it come through in utilization of revolvers, right, which are pretty much in check. They aren't moving much and down in some cases, so people are building less inventory given where rates are.\nThey may be making decisions on like how fast they want to invest in their businesses, and so you're seeing that come through in loan growth, which is sensible for -- from their perspective. I think when you look across the portfolio, there are certainly pockets where you may be seeing margin compression still or different idiosyncratic issues. But across the portfolio, the credit quality is still good.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. And do you think your customers have felt the hit from higher rates already? Or is that on the come?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think they certainly felt it so far, right? I mean, most of them have variable-rate loan that they service, right? And obviously, the longer rates stay high, they'll maybe feel it more. But certainly, I think they've been impacted.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. And just one separate quick question on the outlook for buybacks. Clearly, big reset lower. When you -- like your excess capital, you probably have visibility on the worst case on Basel endgame.\nIt's very rare that banks have excess capital when the stocks are actually near lower. You're creating a tangible book. How do you think about outside of CCAR and SCB in terms of near-term pace of buybacks over the next few quarters relative to what we did this quarter?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, we're not going to get into like trying to give you a view on pacing. We're going to go -- we have a process we go through every quarter to look at all of what's happening. First, it's like how are we going to support clients, what's demand we're seeing, what kind of risks are out there.\nIn the fourth quarter, we have the FDIC special assessment potentially coming. And so there's a whole -- each quarter, there's going to be a whole range of things that we're going to go through, and then we'll decide on pacing.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC. Your line is open, sir.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGood morning. Thank you. Mike, can you share with us -- you and your peers, as well as investors, we've all been surprised with how this deposit trend of moving money into higher-yielding deposits is going slower than expected. Is there any categories within your deposit base, whether it's just your regular consumer deposits or high net worth deposits or the nonoperational commercial deposits that are moving more slowly? And I know you said you expect it to happen, but is there something that says that it could pick up real quickly in the next six months? Or is it just a gradual increase?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Gerard, I think you really have to pick it apart by the different businesses. I think in the wealth business, it moved quite quickly, right, in terms of seeing deposits decline from where they were. And that is now moderated, so it's good to see that that shifting has sort of slowed down quite substantially in the quarter relative to the last couple of quarters.\nOn the consumer side, the majority of the deposits that we've got sit in accounts with less than $250,000. And so to some degree, these are -- a large degree, these are operational accounts for folks. And so there's some portion of those funds that are never going to move into other places because people need it in the accounts to live and operate every day. And so I think what's -- so I think we'll see, right? And I think we're all in a bit of uncharted territory at this point with rates being where they are and the pace at which they got there, quantitative tightening happening.\nAnd so I think we need to be prepared for it to change. Exactly at what pace and over what period of time, we'll see. But we certainly haven't seen deposit pricing move the way we modeled it a year ago, for sure.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. And then as a follow-up, since you and Charlie have come onboard, Wells has really done a very good job in returning that excess capital. I understand everything that's going on today, and you guys described it in your comments. Can you share with us, is there a buffer -- whenever the final numbers come out, are you guys planning to keep a 100-basis-point buffer above that? Or any color there?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. We haven't decided exactly what it'll -- what the buffer will look like after Basel 3 is implemented. But so far, what we've said a number of times is that 100 basis points is about where we've been targeting. Obviously, we've been running above that for a while, but we'll -- as we get a better view of where these rules are going to shake out, we'll probably talk about that more.\nBut I would think that 100 basis points, at least for now, is sort of the bottom end of the range.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nVery good. Much appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd that was our final question for today. I will now turn it over to your speakers for closing remarks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAll righty. Everyone, thank you very much. We look forward to talking to you again next quarter. Take care now.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nMatt OConnor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\n"}
{"date": "Jan 12, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET", "exchange": "NYSE: WFC", "q": "2023-Q4", "ticker": "WFC", "transcript": "Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nWelcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo fourth-quarter 2023 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf, and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss fourth-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth-quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth-quarter results, as well as our net interest income and expense expectations for 2024, before we take your questions. Let me start with some 2023 financial highlights.\nAlthough our improved 2023 results benefited from the strong economic environment and higher interest rates, our continued focus on efficiency and strong credit discipline were important contributors as well. We grew net income and diluted earnings per share with higher revenue and lower expenses. Revenue growth was driven by strong growth in net interest income as well as higher noninterest income. Our expenses were down from a year ago, benefiting from lower operating losses as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives.\nAs expected, net charge-offs increased from historical low levels, and our allowance for credit losses increased as well. We continue to closely monitor our portfolios, taking credit tightening actions as appropriate. We returned a significant amount of capital to our shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend from $0.30 per share to $0.35 per share in the third quarter, and we repurchased $12 billion of common stock. Average loans increased modestly with growth in the first half of the year, offsetting declines later in the year, reflecting weaker loan demand as well as credit tightening actions.\nAverage deposits were down driven by consumer spending as well as customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives. The financial health of our consumers remained strong. While average deposit balances per customer continue to decline from their peak, they remained above pre-pandemic levels as wage growth has more than offset increased spending. Having said that, there are cohorts of customers that are more stressed.\nConsumer spending remained strong. Credit card spend was up 15% for the year and was remarkably stable throughout the year with growth rates strong across all categories, except fuel, which was impacted by lower gas prices. Debit card spending was up 1% for the year. Discretionary spend growth slowed from a year ago while non-discretionary spend was stable.\nOur risk and control work remains our top priority, and I refer you to the comments I made last quarter regarding both our progress in completing the work as well as the risks that remain. We continue to execute on our strategic priorities. And while it is early and we have more to do, we are starting to see improved growth and increased market share in parts of the company which we believe will drive higher returns over time. Let me provide just a few examples.\nOur new credit card products have driven an increase in consumer spend at a rate significantly better than the industry average. We've also been investing in the corporate investment bank. CIB revenue grew 26% from a year ago, and our investment banking and trading market shares increased. The positive results in both areas were accomplished while maintaining our existing risk appetite.\nAdditionally, continued execution of our more focused home lending strategy should also produce higher returns and earnings over the next several years. And while our consumer, small and business banking, commercial banking, and wealth and investment management business remains strong, opportunities to increase share are significant. Other accomplishments include we launched a new co-branded credit cards with Choice Hotels, building on the new products we've launched over the last couple of years. We continued to enhance our mobile app, which is driving mobile adoption momentum, adding 1.6 million mobile active customers in 2023 and increasing mobile logins 11% from a year ago.\nConsumers interacted over 20 million times last year with Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant. We exceeded our $150 million commitment to help advance racial equity in home ownership. Our special purpose credit program lowered mortgage rates and reduced financing costs to help thousands of customers. For commercial clients, we continued to invest in order to have the right people and the right capabilities to better penetrate our customer base.\nWe continue to attract experienced bankers to our investment bank, helping us drive growth in priority products and sectors. Throughout 2023, we added new heads and co-heads of equity capital markets, global mergers and acquisitions, financial institutions, financial sponsors, healthcare, and technology, media, and telecom. We've also started to see the benefit of the targeted investments we are making in our trading capabilities, including adding talent and improved technology with a focus on supporting our core clients. Finally, we're launching a partnership with Centerbridge, which helps us provide our middle market clients with access to alternative sources of capital, another example of how we're providing solutions for our clients.\nInvesting in our business and introducing new products and services remains a priority in 2024, and Mike will highlight some of the opportunities later on the call. In 2023, we also continued to take a closer look at the businesses that were not in sync with our strategic priorities. As I mentioned, we simplified the home lending business, which included exiting the correspondent business. We are reducing the size of our servicing portfolio as well as optimizing our retail team to align with our narrower customer focus.\nIn the third quarter, we sold private equity investments in certain Norwest Equity Partners and Norwest Mezzanine Partners funds. We also continue to invest in the communities we serve throughout the year, and you can see many examples at the beginning of our slide presentation. As we look forward, our business performance remains sensitive to interest rates and the health of the U.S. economy but we are confident that the actions we are taking will drive stronger results over the cycle.\nWe are closely monitoring credit, and while we've seen modest deterioration, it remains consistent with our expectations. Our capital position remains strong, and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority. Mike will talk more about our expectations for 2024, but I'd like to make a couple of points. First, we have seen and have said that we expect net interest income to decline from the high levels we saw as rates were rising last year.\nAnd given that we remain modestly asset-sensitive, the implied Fed rate path reflected in recent forward curves impacts our outlook for NII. Significant uncertainty exists regarding eventual timing and extent of Federal Reserve interest rate actions. Mike will give you our expectations for net interest income, but please recognize that it is based upon a series of market assumptions, which may be right or may be wrong. We hope the overview of our assumptions is helpful.\nSecond, we remain focused on tightly controlling our expenses, but there are several moving pieces, which Mike will walk you through. We will continue to invest what's necessary for our risk and control work. We continue to realize expense efficiencies. And at this point, we are planning to increase our investment spending to create better growth and higher returns in future.\nOur expected efficiencies roughly offset our planned increase in additional spend at this point. Decisions on how much to invest are dynamic. We closely monitor the outcomes of our investments, and we will adjust our plans based on the success we see. We are focused on our shorter-term results but remain committed to building a well-managed, faster-growing, and higher return company over the medium and longer term.\nI have said and I remain excited about the opportunities to increase our share and returns across all of our businesses. We believe the actions we have taken and continue to take, provide the path to 50% ROTCE. I want to conclude by thanking our employees for their dedication, talent, and all they do to move our company forward. I'm excited about Wells Fargo's future and all that we will accomplish in the year ahead.\nMike, over to you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. The first couple of slides summarize how we helped our customers and communities last year, some of which Charlie highlighted, so I'm going to start with our fourth quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the fourth quarter was 3.4 billion, or $0.86 per diluted common share. Our fourth quarter results included 1.9 billion or $0.40 per share for the FDIC special assessment, and 1.1 billion of severance expense, including 969 million or $0.20 per share for planned actions.\nThese expenses were partially offset by 621 million or $0.17 per share of discrete tax benefits related to the resolution of prior-period tax matters. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 5. Our CET1 ratio increased to 11.4% in the fourth quarter, 2.5 percentage points above our regulatory minimum plus buffers. This increase was driven by our earnings and an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income, reflecting lower interest rates and tighter mortgage-backed security spreads.\nDuring the fourth quarter, we repurchased 2.4 billion in common stock. We repurchased a total of 12 billion in common stock in 2023, and we currently expect to be able to repurchase more than this amount in 2024. We will continue to consider current market conditions, including interest rate movements, risk-weighted asset levels, stress test results, as well as any potential economic uncertainty with respect to the amount and timing of share repurchases over the coming quarters. Turning to credit quality on Slide 7.\nAs expected, net loan charge-offs increased, up 17 basis points from the third quarter to 53 basis points of average loans, driven by commercial real estate office and credit card loans. The increase in commercial net loan charge-offs reflected the higher losses in commercial real estate office, while losses in the rest of our commercial portfolio were stable from the third quarter. As expected, losses started to materialize in our commercial real estate office portfolio as market fundamentals remained weak. The losses were across a number of loans spread across various markets and were driven by borrower performance, lower appraisals where the result of properties or loans being sold at a loss.\nWe substantially built reserves for this portfolio throughout 2023 as criticized and nonperforming assets increased. And while we expect additional losses in the coming quarters given the market fundamentals and capital markets and liquidity challenges in this sector, the amounts will likely going to be uneven and episodic. Our commercial real estate team has a rigorous monitoring process and continues to derisk and reduce exposure, and we're using this information to evaluate our allowance, which I will discuss later. Consumer net loan charge-offs continued to increase and were up 118 million from the third quarter to 79 basis points of average loans.\nThe increase was driven by the credit card portfolio, which performed as expected with increased losses driven by recent vintages maturing. Nonperforming assets increased 3% from the third quarter as growth in commercial nonaccrual loans more than offset declines in consumer. The increase in commercial real estate non-accrual loans was driven by a 567 million increase in office non-accrual loans. Moving to Slide 8.\nOur allowance for credit losses increased slightly in the fourth quarter, driven by an increase for credit card and commercial real estate loans, partially offset by a lower allowance for auto loans. The table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio. While the charge offs we took in the fourth quarter were contemplated in our allowance, we are still early in the cycle and after going through our quarterly review process, the coverage ratio in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio remained relatively stable at 11%. On Slide 9, we highlight loans and deposits.\nAverage loans were down from both the third quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continued to grow, while most other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 122 basis points from a year ago and 12 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher interest rate environment.\nAverage deposits declined 3% from a year ago as growth in corporate and investment banking was more than offset by declines in our other deposit gathering businesses, reflecting continued consumer spending and customers reallocating cash into higher yielding alternatives. Period-end deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up 4.2 billion from the third quarter as declines in consumer banking and lending were offset by slightly higher deposits in wealth and investment management for the first time in over a year, as well as higher commercial deposits, which included our efforts to attract clients operational deposits. As expected, our average deposit costs continued to increase up 22 basis points from the third quarter to 158 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments. The pace of the increase was similar to the third quarter.\nOur mix of deposits continued to shift with our percentage of non-interest bearing deposits declining to 27%. Turning to net interest income on Slide 10. Fourth-quarter net interest income declined 662 million or 5% from a year ago due to lower deposit loan balances partially offset by the impact of higher interest rates. I'll provide details on our 2024 net interest income expectations later on the call.\nTurning to expenses on Slide 11. While our fourth-quarter non-interest expense included the FDIC special assessment and 1.1 billion of severance expense, including 969 million for planned actions, expenses declined from a year ago driven by lower operating losses. While most of the planned actions should result in lower headcount, some of the actions are related to our workforce location strategy, which should lower occupancy costs and provide other benefits but may not always reduce headcount. Total expenses increased from the third quarter, driven by the FDIC special assessment and higher severance expense.\nPersonnel expense increased 554 million from the third quarter as higher severance expense was partially offset by lower benefits and incentive compensation expense, including certain year-end adjustments, as well as the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower headcount. Turning to our operating segment, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 12. Consumer, small, and business banking revenue increased 1% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income, reflecting higher interest rates partially offset by lower deposit balances. We've been focusing on controlling expenses and lowering the cost to serve our customers, which includes driving digital adoption, simplifying our product portfolio, and using technology to automate our operating environment.\nAs our customers continue to shift to lower cost channels resulting in fewer teller transactions and handled call volumes, we've reduced our total number of branches by over 280 or 6% from a year ago. At the same time, we have been refurbishing our branches as part of an accelerated multiyear effort to transform and refresh our full branch network. I'll highlight other ways we are investing to improve the customer experience later on the call. Home lending revenue increased 7% from a year ago.\nLower gain on sale margins and originations, as well as lower loan balances were more than offset by improved valuations on loans held for sale due to losses in the fourth quarter of 2022. We continued to reduce headcount home lending in the fourth quarter, down 36% from a year ago, reflecting market conditions as well as our new strategy. Credit card revenue declined 1% from a year ago, driven by the impact of introductory promotional rates and higher rewards expense, partially offset by higher loan balances and interchange revenue. Payment rates have been relatively stable over the past year and remained above pre-pandemic levels.\nNew account growth continued to be strong, up 17% from a year ago. Auto revenue declined 19% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. And personal lending revenue was up 13% from a year ago due to higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 13.\nMortgage originations declined 69% from a year ago and 30% from the third quarter, reflecting the progress we made on our strategic objectives for this business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. As we executed on our strategic objectives, we've also made significant progress on reducing the amount of third-party loans serviced, down 18% from a year ago. The size of our auto portfolio has declined for seven consecutive quarters, and balances were down 11% at the end of the fourth quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 34% year over year, reflecting credit tightening actions.\nDebit card spend increased 2% from a year ago, with both discretionary and non-discretionary spend up 2%, with growth in most categories except for home improvement, fuel, and travel. Credit card spending continued to be strong was up 15% from a year ago. All categories grew with double-digit growth rates in every category except fuel, home improvement, and [Inaudible] apparel. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 14.\nMiddle market banking revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher deposit related fees, reflecting lower earnings credit rates. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 9% year over year due to the impact of higher interest rates and improved results on equity investments. Average loan balances were up 2% from a year ago, driven by growth in asset-based lending and leasing. Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 15.\nBanking revenue increased 15% from a year ago, driven by higher lending revenue, higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products, and stronger treasury management results. As Charlie highlighted, we've successfully hired experienced bankers, which is helping us deliver for our clients and positioning us well for when markets improve. Commercial real estate revenue grew 2% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates, partially offset by lower loan and deposit balances. Markets revenue increased 33% from a year ago, driven by higher revenue and structured products, equities, credit products, and commodities.\nAverage loans were down 3% from a year ago with growth in markets more than offset by declines in banking and commercial real estate. On Slide 16, wealth and investment management revenue declined 1% compared to a year ago, reflecting lower net interest income, driven by lower deposit balances as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher yielding alternatives. The decline in net interest income from a year ago was partially offset by higher asset-based fees due to increased market valuations. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so fourth-quarter results reflected market valuations as of October 1st, which were higher from a year ago, asset-based fees in the first quarter will reflect valuations as of January 1st, which were also higher from a year ago.\nAverage loans were down 3% from a year ago, driven by decline in securities based lending. Slide 17 highlights our corporate results. Revenue declined 345 million from a year ago, reflecting higher deposit crediting rates paid to the operating segments. This decline was partially offset by improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments.\nTurning to our expectations for 2024 starting on Slide 18. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income. As we look forward, there are a number of factors that could impact our results, including the ultimate path of rates, the shape of the yield curve, quantitative tightening and fiscal deficits, consumer behavior, and competitive behavior to name just a few, all of which we have little to no control over. This makes it particularly difficult to estimate net interest income for 2024.\nThere is more uncertainty than usual given the market's strong view of rate cut timing in the quantum. Looking at our results, while we had strong growth in full-year net interest income in 2023 versus 2022, our net interest income came down modestly each quarter last year, driven by the higher deposit pricing and mixed changes. You can see this impact when you analyze our fourth-quarter net interest income, which was down approximately 3% from our full-year 2023 net interest income of 52.4 billion. Our current expectation is that full year 2024 net interest income could potentially be approximately 7% to 9% lower than our full year 2023.\nThis expectation is anchored on the forward rate curve and a series of business assumptions including: lower rates in the recent forward rate curve, which given our modestly asset sensitive position would be a headwind to net interest income; a slight decline in average loans for the full year, which includes modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year; reinvestment of lower yielding securities runoff into higher yielding assets, which would also modestly extend the duration of the investment portfolio; further attrition in consumer banking and lending deposits, as well as continued mix shift from lower yielding products to higher yielding; deposits in our other deposit gathering businesses are expected to be relatively stable, and market funding will replace the decline in consumer deposits as needed. We currently expect that net interest income will trough toward the end of this year. As we've done in prior years, we are also assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn in 2024 will depend on a variety of factors, which many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and pricing, and loan demand.\nTurning to our 2024 expense expectations on Slide 19. We started our focus on efficiency initiatives three years ago, and we've successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately 10 billion of gross expense saves. Through our efficiency initiatives we have reduced headcount every quarter since third quarter of 2020, and headcount is down 16% since the end of 2020. Looking at our expectations for this year and following the waterfall on the slide from left to right, we reported 55.6 billion of non-interest expense in 2023, which included the 1.9 billion FDIC special assessment.\nExcluding this item, expenses would have been 53.6 billion, which we believe is a good starting point for discussion of 2024 expenses. Looking at the next bar, we expect severance expense to be approximately 1.3 billion lower, driven by the 969 million expense we took in the fourth quarter for planned actions. We expect expenses to increase by at least 300 million due to higher revenue related expense, driven by wealth and investment management. Revenue related expenses will ultimately be a function of activity and market levels, and therefore could be higher or lower than this estimate.\nAt this point, we expect all other expenses to be flat, though there are significant efficiencies and increased investments included in this expectation. We expect approximately 2.7 billion of gross expense reductions in 2024 due to the efficiency initiatives. We highlight in the slide some of the areas where we anticipate additional savings and continue to believe we have more opportunities beyond 2024. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work are separate from our efficiency initiatives, and we will continue to make significant investments in our risk and control infrastructure.\nWhile we remain focused on executing on our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to invest and we expect approximately 1.1 billion of incremental technology and equipment expense, reflecting higher costs related to the amortization of investment in prior years, as well as new investments planned for 2024. We also expect merit increases of approximately 700 million, which are primarily awarded to employees with lower salaries. We highlight some of the other areas where we plan to invest on the next slide. Our 2024 expense outlook includes ongoing business related operating losses of approximately 1.3 billion, similar to the level we had in 2023.\nAs previously disclosed, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses. So, putting this all together, we expect 2024 non-insurance expense to be approximately 52.6 billion. It's important to note that while we've made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, as Charlie highlighted, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company. Given how critical it is to continue to invest in our business, on Slide 20, we provide some examples of our areas of focus for 2024.\nLet me highlight a few. Building the right risk and control infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the technology investments we've already made to transform how we serve both our consumer and commercial customers, and we plan to continue investing these areas this year throughout our businesses. We are planning to hire more bankers and advisors to grow our Wells Fargo Premier Offering to our affluent clients.\nWe plan to launch a new travel oriented credit card as part of our Autograph suite of products, as well as a new small business credit card this year. To better serve our commercial clients, we plan to continue higher within investment banking and commercial banking to support priority sectors and products to help drive growth. Now, let me conclude with Slide 21, where we will discuss return on tangible common equity. When we first discussed our path to improving returns on the fourth-quarter 2020 earnings call, we had an 8% ROTCE.\nSince then, we have taken multiple actions to improve our returns, including executing on our efficiency initiatives, investing in our businesses to help drive growth, and returning excess capital to shareholders, including increasing our common stock dividend $0.10 to $0.35 per share and repurchasing $32 billion of common stock. These actions help to improve our ROTCE. Our reported ROTCE in the fourth quarter was 9%, but as we highlight in the table, our ROTCE was impacted by a number of notable items. Our 2023 returns also reflected the benefit of rising rates, which helped to drive strong net interest income growth, and as I've already highlighted, we expect net interest income to decline this year.\nWe still believe, we have an achievable path to a sustainable 15% ROTCE over the medium term as we continue to make progress on transforming the company. There are several key factors that support our belief. Our ability to return excess capital, we currently have a significant amount of excess capital, 2.5 percentage points above our regulatory minimum buffers for CET1. And as I already highlighted, we expect to increase our share repurchases this year.\nI highlighted the progress we've already made to reposition our home lending business, including reducing the amount of third-party mortgage loans serviced by 18% from a year ago. As we continue to streamline this business, we expect the profitability to improve. We've grown our credit card business with balances up 40% since the end of 2021 and new accounts 25% higher than the fourth quarter of 2021. However, the current profitability of this business has been impacted by acquisition costs and allowance build, and we expect profitability to improve as the portfolio matures.\nFinally, we've made significant investments the last few years across our franchise to better serve our customers, and help drive growth. We expect the revenue growth that these investments should generate in businesses like corporate investment banking and wealth and investment management will help fund additional investments. So, we have many drivers to close the gap and improve returns. In summary, our results in 2023 demonstrated our commitment to improving our financial performance.\nWe grew revenue, reduced expenses, increased capital returns to shareholders, and maintained our strong capital position. We will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\nAt this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] And our first question of the day will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Sir, your line is open.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Happy New Year. Mike, I was -- appreciate all the NII detail. Just given all the different puts and takes that you cited, I was hoping you could provide some context as to how you're thinking about the exit rate for NII in 2024 per the guidance, just given expectations per the street that NII should inflect positively in 2025, just want to get a sense as to how you're thinking about where NII could potentially trough or stabilize based on the forward curve?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, no, I appreciate the question. When you -- based on what we gave you, Steve, I think, we said on the page and in my remarks that we do expect it to start to inflect and trough as we get toward the end of the year. Exactly when that happens, I think we'll sort of see. We're not going to get too specific there, but we do expect that you would start to see a trough as we get to the end of the year and into 2025.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nVery helpful. And then for my follow-up just on expenses, the core expense guidance shows another net reduction in 2024. You noted that you're making investments, but those will be offset by efficiency savings. Just want to get a sense as to how long you can sustain that flattish core expense trajectory, continue to fund investments with future efficiencies.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I think when we think about the efficiency journey that we're on, I think Charlie and I have been both pretty clear consistently now that there's more to do and 2024 is just another year in the journey, right? And we've got more to do post that to continue to drive efficiency across the place, where we're going to net out on a year-to-year basis in terms of the net spend, I'm not going to try to predict. But as you look across the company, I think we're just continuing to methodically make progress to drive automation, efficiency, reduce third-party spend, reduce our real estate footprint across all of the different dimensions. And I think we think we've got more to do, and that'll continue into 2025 and beyond.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThat's great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. Mike, I wanted to ask about the fee income drivers for this year. Charlie mentioned obviously some examples of progress that you've gotten leverage on investments and then obviously you've got cyclical headwinds and tailwinds. So, maybe just could you walk through some of the bigger fee income drivers and give your sense of puts and takes and how you're feeling this year going into the fee revenue outlook?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, sure. Thanks, John. When you look at the components there, I mean, the largest one is going to be our advisory fees in the wealth and investment management business. And market levels are higher than they were this time last year.\nAnd so, if that holds or gets better as many people predicting, that should be constructive for that fee. When you start looking at the other line items like trading, the market's got to cooperate. We're happy with the progress we've been making across the different businesses there, but the market is going to have to cooperate as well for that to continue. We had a number of impairments across our venture capital portfolio this year.\nAt some point, that should start to peter out, and we'll see that inflect. And then the other fee lines should be pretty predictable for the most part as you sort of look forward.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And just to follow up on the net interest income idea of bottoming toward the end of the year, theoretically, what would be the drivers of that kind of bottoming? Do you have fixed asset reprice that helps, or is it kind of assumed new asset generation? Maybe you could just wrap that into some thoughts about what would drive that inflection in the context of any update on rate sensitivity as well? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. Maybe I'll start with the latter part first. And -- as you can see in the data we gave in the presentation, we're anchoring it to what was in the forward curve as of a day last week, which is not that dissimilar to what you have today. And I think when you look at sensitivity to that, our interest rate sensitivity disclosures in this case are a pretty good estimate for how to think about whether if rates are a little bit higher or a little bit lower than what's in that forward curve.\nAnd if you look at where we were at the end of the third quarter, we were still modestly asset sensitive. That'll still be the case at the end of the fourth quarter. It will come down a little bit from where it was, but will still be asset sensitive. But its -- and if you look at the forward curve, I think on average, rates are coming down something like 50 basis points.\nAnd so, it is pretty linear math when you look at the sensitivities that we included in the queue. When you look at the underlying assumptions as you go into the year, we've got loan growth being pretty muted in the beginning part of the year. That'll hopefully start to pick up as we get later in the year. So, that will be a driver of it as you get toward the end of the year.\nYou'll have some stabilization. We're expecting stabilization of pretty stable deposits across the commercial and wealth management businesses. At some point, the consumer deposits will also stabilize, and the mix will stabilize as well. You've got continued asset repricing that happens in there as well.\nSo, it's a little bit of all of it that brings you to the point at which it starts to trough and inflect. But again, exactly when that's going to happen, we'll sort of leave -- we'll leave till later in the year, but we do expect that'll happen as we get closer to the end of the year.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nUnderstood. Thanks.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nHi, thanks. I'm sorry if I'm going to stay on theme, but just as you start to the beginning of the year and deposit price continues to flow through and the mix continues to change and as far as the DDAs, I'm wondering if you could just help us understand how do you expect that trajectory. DDAs definitely still out flowing, which is expected, but in terms of mix and then just how you expect the deposit rate of change or the downside beta to act through the cycle. Can you help us understand that, Mike? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. When you look at what's happening just on deposits, the trend that we've been seeing now on the mix shift has been pretty consistent for the last two or three quarters at least. And so -- so, at some point that'll moderate more, but it's been pretty consistent. And so, that's probably a decent assumption as you sort of go into the first part of the year at least.\nWhen you start looking at deposit pricing can later in the year, as rates start to move, on the commercial side, rates and betas have been competitive now and pretty high for a while, and they'll be just as rate sensitive on the way back down. That's part of the bargain on the commercial side is you get good competitive betas on the way up, and you also get them on the way down. On the consumer side, there's been less movement on standard pricing across many of the products, but you've had the introduction of CDs and promo rates, and all that stuff will start to move down pretty quickly as the expectation for rates do as well.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. So, if I think about that, then would you imply that the first-quarter starting point, we see a little bit more of an NII step down, and then as you get to that hopeful stabilization in the back half, like just because of how that moves?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think based on what we gave you, right, so we are expecting a full year NII to be down 7% to 9% hopefully. And if it starts to stabilize as you get to the end of the year, then that implies a step down in the beginning of the year. Exactly, we're not going to give you a number by quarter, but I -- you would -- you should expect to step down as you go in the beginning part of the year.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. I understand. OK. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nGood morning, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. I was hoping you might be able to spend just another moment on the longer-term cost opportunity. I guess I'm just curious if there's a point where some of the investment spending pressures ease and there might still be an opportunity for costs to decline more visibly on an underlying basis.\nOr by contrast, is this level of investment spending, is that something that'll just be sort of pretty consistent year in and year out?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, Scott, it really is going to depend. I will highlight one thing though. In the slide that we have there, we -- I noted that part of what's driving the investment spend this year is the tech and equipment line moving up. And so, that won't continue to move up at that pace forever.\nAnd so, that does start to moderate as you go out into the future. But as you look at the other investments we're making, we're going to try to be very thoughtful about looking at the opportunities that we have across each of the businesses, thinking about short-, medium-, long-term results and making sure that we're sort of calibrating all that, right? But I would expect us to continue to make investments in each of the businesses. And I think that ultimately, that's what's going to drive great returns and better performance over time.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nPerfect. Thank you. And then maybe just a question on credit. You all have been very proactive in dealing with sort of the office CRE situation.\nJust curious to hear how your -- what your thoughts are on how this cycle, that asset class sort of plays out from here. Does it just remain a long slog? Or is there perhaps a point where your conservatism has sort of gotten ahead of issues, and you might actually be able to relieve a bit of that really healthy double-digit reserve?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. Look, as we look at the reserve, and then I'll come back to the broader point there, at some point we'll start using the reserve more fully, and then that allowance coverage ratio will come down. No doubt. I mean, that's the way it should work when you think about CECL and the way the accounting should work.\nI think, in terms of your broader point, it's a long movie. We're still -- we're not -- we're past the opening credits, but we're still in the beginning of the movie. And so, it's going to take some time for this to play out. And as I noted, it'll be somewhat of an uneven and episodic sort of nature to the charge offs and as you work through this because every property has a different timeline in terms of events that it needs to sort of work through.\nSo, I do think that we've got a while for this to play out through the system.\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nOK. Perfect. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThank you. The next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. I guess maybe just to the -- thanks for all the details on NII expenses and the ROTCE. I guess if you had to -- and it's not lost upon anyone with regards to the investments you've made in the franchise. But when you look at the slide, fourth-quarter '20 ROTCE 8%, three years fast forward, it's gone from 8% to 9%.\nAssuming there's no real perfect world to operate a bank, from a shareholder perspective, quickly, do you think we can get from 9% to 15%? You've given us the moving pieces. But I'm just wondering maybe Charlie, Mike, how do you think about, is it a two-year slog? Is it longer than that? Love some perspective there.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And I think maybe I'll start and Charlie can chime in. So I think when you look at that page, Ebrahim, I think you really have to look at the impact of the special assessment that in the results, right? And so, that's four percentage points of ROTCE, so think of the underlying operating performance from a returns perspective, more closer to that 13% range. And so, there has been quite a bit of progress since Q4 '20.\nAnd then as you sort of look forward, we highlighted some of the key drivers on the right. And in my commentary, look, we've got a lot of excess capital despite whatever happens with Basel III. And so, we've got room to continue to return that to shareholders. We are in the middle of repositioning and the home lending business, which will drive, not only good, better returns in that business, but improvement across the franchise.\nWe've got the card business, which we're seeing very good performance in as we've launched our new products over the last couple years. And as that matures, we will be meaningful contributor. And then we've got continue to get the benefit of all the other investments that we're making. And so, we feel like we've made a lot of good progress since the 2020.\nAnd then we've got really clear plans to continue to see better performance.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I'll just add a little bit to it. And to be a little bit repetitive, when you look at that slide, again, those are reported numbers. And so, the way we think about it is the earnings power of the company today on an ROTCE basis, you got to make your own assumptions for what's in and out and what normalized net interest income is because we've been clear that we've been over earning. But when you look at and when you add back these expenses like FDIC, which relate to the past and this quarter and aren't going to go forward, our ROTCE is up 50% from where it was.\nSo, that is significant change. On top of that, when we look at the actions, as Mike said, that we've taken in the home lending business, when we see the trajectory of growth that we're seeing in the card business, just as those things mature, let alone being able to deploy the excess capital we have, those are things that are in process. We don't have to really do anything more other than let them mature and let them play out. That is continued movement toward the 15% ROTCE.\nAnd then the last thing I'd say is just away from those things. When we got here, these businesses were not on trajectories to grow. The card business wasn't growing, the corporate investment bank wasn't growing. You can go through them one by one.\nAnd so, as we've talked about making investments, offsetting some of these efficiencies that we've seen and making determinations on whether or not they're paying off, those things that we're seeing these increases in share, we're pretty confident that they are going to continue to drive improved results over time. And so, as I said in my remarks, we're clearly susceptible to market environment both for interest rates and the overall economic environment in the shorter term, but we feel both really good about the progress that we've made. We feel really good about what the path we see going forward is recognizing that there's still a lot more that we have to do.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. That was thorough. Thank you. And just one quick follow-up.\nMike, on CRE. I'm assuming you had some assets moved through the -- off the balance sheet. I'm just wondering, do -- today, relative to a year ago, do you have better visibility on where the clearing prices for some of these non-performing CRE or challenge CRE loans? And are you seeing any pressure spreading beyond CRE offers to other parts of the portfolio in any meaningful way? Thank you.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, look, as time goes by, we've got -- we get better and better information around where things are going to play out. But it is still somewhat specific to the asset. And so, I wouldn't try to generalize yet until we see more transactions and more data points.\nWhen you look at the broader CRE market at least in our portfolio, we are not seeing the stress spread to other parts of it.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHelpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. My first question is a follow-up to Ebrahim's line of questioning on ROTCE. Charlie, Mike's right, obviously, you have plenty of excess capital. As we think about your outlook for not much loan growth in 2024, and obviously there's the asset cap still in place, how should we think about what you're looking for as guideposts to potentially accelerate that buyback from the $2.4 billion level? Is it as far out as the Basel III end game finalization, or would you wait for more clarity near term on the DFAST results in June?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nIt's Mike. I'll take a shot at that Erika. And when you look at the -- when you look at our full-year numbers, we -- I tried to highlight in my comments that we do expect that our repurchases will be higher than what we did in 2023. The exact timing and pace, I'm not going to get into.\nBut then we'll look at all of as we do every quarter, we look at all of the different risks that could be out there including, thinking about where CCAR or the stress tests will come out. And from a Basel III perspective, we are in really good shape. As we said last quarter, we're already above where we need to be from a -- if it was fully implemented as is, and we're hopeful that that won't be the case. And so, and we're going to generate more capital as we go through the year.\nAnd so, we've got, as I said, we've got plenty of excess capital. We plan to buy back more stock than we did in 2023, and we'll leave the exact timing and pace to future calls.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nThank you. And, Mike, my follow-up question is another one on NII. I did notice that your short-term borrowings went up a lot in 2023. And just looking at the asset side, it seemed like it was funding that increase in liquidity to 204 billion cash in cash at the Fed at period-end.\nAnd I'm wondering, as we're thinking about your liability mix in 2024. And then I think your average balance sheet size was 1.91 trillion at the end of the year. I'm just wondering if we should expect the balance sheet to shrink because you don't -- you may not need all those short-term borrowings, or is there a reason why you feel like you want to hold that much liquidity at the Fed at this time?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, it is certainly possible, the balance sheet will get smaller throughout the year. I think that'll just be a function of what we ultimately see on loan growth, how much we end up deploying into securities as we go through the year, and where it makes sense, we will let the balance sheet just ebb and flow back down. And I think that's the way we're sort of thinking about it now. And I think at this point, there's not a lot of cost to leaving at the Fed given where the -- where A-IRB is.\nAnd so, that'll change as rates start to come down and we'll calibrate the overall size based on what we think the opportunity is.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nThank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. On the NII outlook of down 7% to 9%, can you maybe help us think about the expected net interest margin trajectory through the year? How we should think about that in the context of what you're expecting in terms of earning asset yields and dynamic on funding costs? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, we don't -- we're not going to try to predict exactly where the NIM is going to go quarter by quarter. But I think as you would guess, right, assuming the balance sheets that are a relatively stable size as NII starts to come down, the NIM will compress, right? And there'll be tailwinds and headwinds related as the assets. As the securities portfolio reprices, that'll be a tailwind. As you start to see variable rate loans come down, as rates come down, that'll be a headwind.\nAnd so, I think most of it should be relatively simple to kind of estimate as you sort of plug the assumptions into your model, but there's no sort of magic to it. But you would expect NIM to continue to come down as the balance sheet stays stable and NII comes down.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. All right, thanks. And then separately on commercial real estate, and can you maybe give us a little more color in terms of where you saw the stress, what types of office properties and what type of marks to the underlying assets are you seeing as you're reappraising the properties? And given the -- I guess, maybe just talk about the level of confidence you have in the updated 7.9% office reserve at this level.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And really the allowance I would -- the allowance coverage ratio I would pay attention to on the slide is our CIB, CRE office portfolio, which is close to 11%. And that's really the institutional style office buildings where really the stress is coming through. When you look at the charge-offs, it was across a number of properties.\nIt wasn't one or two. It was pretty geographically dispersed across different cities and across different parts of the country. So, there wasn't an over concentration anywhere. Each of the properties have very specific situations, and so there was a pretty wide range in terms of where the price cleared or where the appraisal came in.\nA good chunk of these properties are being marked because we've got new appraisals for various reasons. A small amount of it was actually realized because the note or the property was sold. And so, for a good amount of it, we'll see how it ultimately plays out. There could be recoveries as we go.\nBut it was a pretty -- as you would expect, it was a substantial decline in what people thought the value of the properties was just a year or two ago.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK, got it. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGood morning, Mike. Good morning, Charlie. Mike, on the guide for the net interest income on the forward curve. If the forward curve is incorrect and we're sitting here a year from now, and rather than seeing a 415 or 416 Fed funds rate, if it's close to the 5% or 490, how much of a positive would that be for a higher net interest income for you guys? Have you guys -- I'm assuming you use different sensitivity analysis to kind of give yourself a sense of where net interest income could go under different rate scenarios.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I would -- and just like I think John McDonald asked it earlier. I would look at our interest rate sensitivity, Gerard. And as I said, we're still modestly asset sensitive, a little bit less at the end of the fourth quarter than the third quarter.\nAnd I think it is a pretty linear sort of equation there. And so, I would just look at the 100 basis point move that we have in there. It's around a couple of billion dollars of move when you look at that as of the end of the third quarter. Again, it'll come in slightly from that likely into -- at the end of the fourth quarter and just use whatever assumption you want, and it is a pretty linear.\nWithin reason, it's a pretty linear equation.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nOK. And then you guys obviously have been very focused on the expense reduction and admirable job since you guys all got there, obviously. Is there any way that you could bring down the operating losses? I think they've been pretty consistent at 1.3 billion for a bit. Is there anything in there that down the road you could change where it would actually fall? Or is it just something that just the cost of doing business with fraud, theft, and etc.?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, there's certainly some portion of that that will -- is just the cost of doing business. Now, even on the fraud and BAU operating losses, we, as most people I would think, are continuing to invest in capabilities to reduce those more and more. And we continue to do that as well. And then I think as we continue to put more of the issues, historical issues behind us, hopefully the overall number continues to trend downward.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. I appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nHi. Any thoughts on where card charge-offs go in '24? I think you're about 4% this quarter. And I guess you've had really good growth. So, if we lag it like we used to do in the old days, maybe we get about 4.5%.\nI don't know if that's a good starting point or just any way to frame losses from here. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I won't give you a specific number, but the way you're thinking about it is exactly right. I think as you look at the portfolio that we have, which might be a little different than others is we launched the new product set starting a little over two years ago, but you've sort of seen more meaningful new account growth starting about two years ago. And so, you're in that normal maturation curve and seasoning of sort of losses as they come on.\nAnd so, we would expect that it would continue to trend a little bit higher from where it is.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nAnd then we're seeing this obviously not just with you guys but kind of across the board in terms of card losses go up, even though we're still in this really good environment in terms of employment and wealth and still a bit of excess savings. Just thoughts on what's driving losses. Again, not just for you, but just for everybody, there's life events that always happen, but it just feels like maybe card losses are getting a little higher than I would have thought with unemployment where it is, and again, like jobs available and all those dynamics. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And maybe I'll start. And I think as Charlie kind of highlighted in his script, the averages all look fine when you look at liquidity or deposit balances. And certainly, even when you look at the cumulative wage growth that you've seen over the last few years, in aggregate, you go, it paints a pretty good picture.\nBut when you go below that, and we've tried to highlight this a few times over the last year or so. When you go below that, there are certainly cohorts of clients where people are stressed. And the further you go down in income levels or the further you go down in wealth levels, the cumulative impact of inflation has really taken a toll. And so, you're going to have some percentage of people that are feeling much more stressed than what the aggregate numbers would imply.\nAnd in some cases, their liquidity is going to be lower than it was pre-COVID. In some cases, they've been having to build bigger credit card balances. And so, for us, it's not a big part of the overall portfolio, but you're going to continue to see that, which is something we should all have expected and expect to see as you go forward.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd the only thing I would add is that that's something that has always existed pre-COVID, right? There were always people that were doing better and there were people that were doing worse. And I think what's important, I speak for ourselves, when we look at our card losses, what we actually are looking at is how they're performing on a vintage basis versus pre-COVID levels. And the curves are right on top of what that is. And so, when we talk about getting back to normal in terms of what we're seeing, that's what we're actually seeing in card losses.\nWe're not seeing at this point anything that goes beyond that.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK, that's helpful. And then just lastly, if I can squeeze in. Remind me, like the targeted customer, I think it's like prime plus, but any way to frame that in terms of whether it's FICO or wealth metric or homeowner percent or any way just to frame it? It is becoming a bigger part of the company, obviously so -- thanks.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look, we're not going to get that specific. But when you look at like, individual products, they're targeted toward different cohorts of clients. But what I would say overall, we feel really good about the credit quality of the new accounts we're putting on.\nAnd in most cases, in most products, the credit profile is better than what we have from the historical backbook.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK, thanks for all the color.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Dave Rochester of Compass Point Research. Your line is open.\nDave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst\nHey, good morning, guys. Sorry for one more question on the NII guide here but was just curious how much of that decline that you're expecting for this year is driven by that continued remix of deposits and the lower non-interest bearing deposits you talked about and where are you assuming that DDA mix settles out this year?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. As you would guess, when you lose non-interest bearing deposits or they shift into higher yielding products, that's going to have a pretty substantial impact. And so, that is a big driver of what the decline is for the rest of the year. We haven't really talked about exactly where it bottoms, but it should stabilize at some point.\nDave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst\nOK. And then on capital, was curious what more buybacks means for capital ratios and that 2.5% buffer you talked about. By the end of '24, all else equal, is the thought that you'll take those ratios and that buffer lower this year?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWe'll see, but I think, I won't try to give you a buyback number. Lots of things go into figuring that out throughout the year. But as we said, we expect buybacks to be bigger than last year, and the level, assuming that nothing significant happens in the macro environment, the level that we're at is higher than we need to be.\nDave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst\nGreat, thanks. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nAnd our last question will come from Manan Gosalia of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nManan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. Two quick ones for me. I know you said your guide includes stable deposits but a shift toward interest bearing deposits. Would an end to QT stop that share shift, or is it different given you're seeing that share shift from the consumer side?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. What we said is we expect stable deposits on the wealth and the commercial side. We do expect some declines on the consumer side. And an end to QT would be a positive.\nManan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nAnd can you expand on that a little bit? Why would that be?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nWell, QT is drains. Well, at some point, more meaningfully drain liquidity out of the banking system, right? So, once you get the RRP facility down to a smaller number, which is likely to happen, then any further QT starts to really remove liquidity more directly out of the banking system. And so, that stops. That's a positive for deposits.\nManan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. And then just on credit, how do falling rates impact your outlook for CRE losses? At the margin, do you feel better about working with borrowers and mitigating losses and NPLs and how long this takes to work out, or have things not changed that meaningfully yet?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHasn't changed that meaningful yet. Really. We're dealing with what is a structural change in sort of demand for real estate in some parts of the country. And so, you got to work through that.\nAnd then I think on the margin, lower rates are helpful, but the bigger issue needs to get worked through first.\nManan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd at this time --\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK. Thanks, everyone, for the questions. See you next time.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nScott Siefers -- Piper Sandler -- Analyst\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nDave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst\nManan Gosalia -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst"}
{"date": "Jan 12, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET", "exchange": "NYSE: WFC", "q": "2024-Q2", "ticker": "WFC", "transcript":"Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nWelcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo second-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded.\nI would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Senior Vice President, Investor Relations\nGood morning, everyone. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charles Scharf; and our CFO, Michael Santomassimo, will discuss second-quarter results then answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our second-quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John. As usual, I'll make some brief comments about our second-quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. So, let me start with some second quarter highlights.\nOur financial performance in the quarter benefited from our ongoing efforts to transform Wells Fargo. We continue to generate strong fee-based revenue growth with increases across most categories compared to a year ago due to both the investments we're making in our businesses and favorable market conditions with particular strength in investment advisory, trading activities, and investment banking. These results more than offset the expected decline in net interest income. Credit performance during the second quarter was consistent with our expectations.\nConsumers have benefited from the strong labor market and wage increases. The performance of our consumer auto portfolio continued to improve, reflecting prior credit tightening actions, and we had net recoveries in our home lending portfolio. While losses in our credit card portfolio increased as expected, early delinquency performance of our recent vintages was aligned with expectations. In our commercial portfolios, losses continued to be driven by commercial real estate office properties, where we expect losses to remain lumpy.\nFundamentals in the institutional owned office real estate market continued to deteriorate as lower appraisals reflect the weak leasing market in many large metropolitan areas across the country. However, they still remain within the assumptions we made when setting our allowance for credit losses. We continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives, which has driven head count to decline for 16 consecutive quarters. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the first quarter.\nThe higher interest rate environment and anticipation of rate cuts continued to result in tepid commercial loan demand, and we have not changed our underwriting standards to chase growth. Balance growth in our credit card portfolio was more than offset by declines across our other consumer portfolios. Average deposits grew modestly from the first quarter, with higher balances in all of our consumer-facing lines of businesses. Now, let me update you on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk controller.\nWe are a different Wells Fargo from when I arrived. Our operational and compliance risk and control build-out is our top priority and will remain so until all deliverables are completed, and we embed this mindset into our culture, similar to the discipline we have for financial and credit risk today. We continue to make progress by completing deliverables that are part of our plans. The numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment.\nWhile we see clear forward momentum, it's up to our regulators to make their own judgments and decide when the work is done to their satisfaction. Progress has not been easy, but tens of thousands of my partners at Wells Fargo have now worked tirelessly for years to deliver the kind of change necessary for a company of our size and complexity, and we will not rest until we satisfy the expectations of our regulators and the high standards we have set for ourselves. While we have made substantial changes and have meaningfully improved our control environment, the industry operates in a heightened regulatory oversight environment, and we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. We are also a different Wells Fargo in how we are executing on other strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time.\nLet me highlight a few examples of the progress we're making. For diversity revenue sources and reducing our reliance on net interest income, we are improving our credit card platform with more competitive offerings, which is both -- which is important both for our customers and strategically for the company. During the second quarter, we launched two new credit cards, a small business card and a consumer card. Since 2021, we have launched nine new credit cards and are almost complete in our initial product build-out.\nThe momentum in this business is demonstrated by continued strong credit card spend and new account growth. We are not lowering our credit standards but see that our strong brand and a great value proposition are being well received by the market. Building a larger credit card business is an investment as new products have significant upfront costs related to marketing, promo rates, onboarding, and allowance, which drive little profitability in the early years. But as long as our assumptions on spend, balance growth, and credit continue to play out as expected, we expect the card business to meaningfully contribute to profit growth in the future as the portfolio matures.\nWe have been methodically growing our corporate investment bank, which has been a priority and continues to be a significant opportunity for us. We are executing on a multiyear investment plan while maintaining our strong risk discipline and our positive momentum continues. We have added significant talent over the past several years and will continue to do so in targeted areas where we see opportunities for growth. Fernando Rivas recently joined Wells Fargo as Co-CEO of Corporate and Investment Banking.\nFernando has deep knowledge of our industry, and his background and skills complement the terrific team Jon Weiss has put together. While we view our work here as a long-term commitment, we expect to see results in the short and medium term and are encouraged by the improved performance we've already seen with strong growth in investment banking fees during the first half of the year. In our wealth and investment management business, we have substantially improved advisor retention and have increased the focus on serving independent advisors and our consumer banking clients, which should ultimately help drive growth. In the commercial bank, we are focused on growing our treasury management business, adding bankers to cover segments where we are underpenetrated and delivering our investment banking and markets capabilities to clients and believe we have significant opportunities in the years ahead.\nAnd we continue to see significant opportunities for consumer, small, and business banking franchise to be a more important source of growth. Let me give you just a few examples of some of the things we're doing here. We continue to optimize and invest in our branch network. While our branch count declined 5% from a year ago, we are being more strategic about branch location strategy.\nWe are accelerating our efforts to refurbish our branches, completing 296 during the first half of this year and are on track to update all of our branches within the next five years. As part of our efforts to enhance the branch experience, we are also increasing our investment in our branch employees and improving technology, including a new digital account opening experience, which has been a positive for both our bankers and our customers. We continue to have strong growth in mobile users with active mobile customers up 6% from a year ago. A year after launching Fargo, our AI-powered virtual assistant, we have had nearly 15 million users and over 117 million interactions.\nWe expect this momentum to continue as we make further enhancements to offer our customers additional self-service features and value-added insights including balance trends and subscription spending. Looking ahead, overall, the U.S. economy remains strong, driven by a healthy labor market and solid growth. However, the economy is slowing and there are continued headwinds from still-elevated inflation and elevated interest rates.\nAs managers of a large complex financial institution, we think about both the risks and the opportunities and work to be prepared for the downside while continually building our ability to serve customers and clients. The actions we have taken to strengthen the company have helped prepare us for a variety of economic environments. And while risks exist, we see significant opportunities in front of us. Our commitment and the progress we are making to build an appropriate operational and compliance risk management framework is foundational for our company, and we will continue to prioritize and dedicate all necessary resources to complete our work.\nWe have a diversified business model, see opportunities to build a broader earnings stream, and are seeing the early progress in our results. And we have maintained strong financial risk discipline and a strong balance sheet. Operating with a strong capital position in anticipation of the uncertainty the stress test regime imposes on large banks and the potential for increases to our regulatory capital requirements resulting from Basel III finalization has served as well. It also allows us to serve our customers' financial needs, and we remain committed to prudently return excess capital to our shareholders.\nAs we previously announced, we expect to increase our third quarter common stock dividend by 14% to $0.40 per share, subject to the approval by the company's board of directors at its regularly scheduled meeting later this month. We repurchased over $12 billion of common stock during the first half of this year. And while the pace will slow, we have the capacity to continue repurchasing stock. I'm proud of the progress we continue to make and thankful to everyone who works at Wells Fargo.\nI'm excited about the opportunities ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the second quarter was 4.9 billion or $1.33 per diluted common share. EPS grew from both the first quarter and a year ago, reflecting the solid performance in our fee-based businesses as we benefited from the market environment and the investments we've been making. We also continue to focus on driving efficiency across the company.\nI will also note that our second-quarter effective income tax rate reflected the impact of the first-quarter adoption of the new accounting standard for renewable energy tax credit investments, which increased our effective tax rate by approximately 3 percentage points versus a year ago. This increase in the effective tax rate had a minimal impact on net income since it had an offsetting increase to noninterest income. Turning to Slide 4. As expected, noninterest income was down, net interest income was down 1.2 billion or 9% from a year ago.\nThis decline was driven by higher funding costs, including the impact of lower deposit balances and customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products in our consumer businesses and higher deposit costs in our commercial businesses, as well as lower loan balances. This was partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. Net interest income declined 304 million or 2% from the first quarter. Given the higher rate environment meet commercial loan demand, loan balances continue to decline as expected.\nWe saw positive trends, including average deposit balances growing from the first quarter with growth in all of our customer-facing businesses, including within our consumer business. Customer migration to higher-yielding alternatives was also lower in the quarter. This slowed the pace of growth in deposit pricing with our average deposit cost up 10 basis points in the second quarter after increasing 16 basis points in the first quarter. If the Fed were to start cutting rates later this year, we expect that deposit pricing would begin to decline with the most immediate impact of new promotional rates in our consumer business and standard pricing for commercial deposits where pricing move faster as rates increase, and we would expect betas to also be higher as rates decline.\nOn Slide 5, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans were down from both the first quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow while most other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results.\nAverage deposits were relatively stable from a year ago as growth in our commercial businesses and corporate funding offset declines in our consumer businesses, driven by customers migrating to higher-yielding alternatives and continued consumer spending. Average deposits grew 4.9 billion from the first quarter. Commercial deposits have grown for three consecutive quarters as we successfully attracted clients' operational deposits. After declining for nearly two years, consumer deposit balances grew modestly from the first quarter.\nWe've seen outflows slow as many rate-seeking customers in wealth and investment management have already moved into cash alternative products, and we've successfully used promotion and retention-oriented strategies to retain and acquire new balances in consumer small and business banking. These improved deposit trends allowed us to reduce higher cost market funding. The migration from noninterest-bearing to interest-bearing deposits was similar to last quarter with our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits declining from 26% in the first quarter to 25%. Turning to noninterest income on Slide 6.\nNoninterest income increased 19% from a year ago, with growth across most categories reflecting both the benefit of the investments we've been making in our businesses as well as the market conditions as Charlie highlighted. This growth more than offset the expected decline in interest income with revenue increasing from a year ago, the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year revenue growth. I will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing our operating segment goals. Turning to expenses on Slide 7.\nSecond-quarter noninterest expense increased 2% from a year ago, driven by higher operating losses, an increase in revenue-related compensation, and higher technology and equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower salaries expense and professional and outside services expense. Operating losses increased from a year ago and included higher customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we are working hard to get behind us. The 7% decline in noninterest expense in the first quarter was primarily driven by seasonally higher personnel expense in the first quarter.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide 8. Net loan charge-offs increased 7 basis points from the first quarter to 57 basis points of average loans. The increase was driven by higher commercial net loan charge-offs, which were up 127 million from the first quarter to 35 basis points of average loans, primarily reflecting higher losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio. While losses in the commercial real estate office portfolio increased in the second quarter after declining last quarter, they were in line with our expectations.\nAs we have previously stated, commercial real estate office losses have been and will continue to be lumpy as we continue to work with clients. We continue to actively work to derisk our office exposure, including a rigorous monitoring process. These efforts helped to reduce our office commitment by 13% and loan balances by 9% from a year ago. Consumer net loan charge-offs increased 25 million from the first quarter to 88 basis points of average loans.\nAuto losses continued to decline, benefiting from the credit tightening actions we implemented starting in late 2021. The increase in credit card losses was in line with our expectations as older vintages are no longer benefiting from pandemic stimulus as more recent vintages -- and as more recent vintages mature. Importantly, the credit performance of our newer vintages has been consistent with our expectations, and we currently expect the credit card charge off rate to decline in the third quarter. Nonperforming assets increased 5% from the first quarter, driven by the higher commercial real estate office nonaccruals.\nMoving to Slide 9. Our allowance for credit losses was down modestly from the first quarter, driven by declines across most asset classes, partially offset by a higher allowance of credit card loans driven by higher balances. Our allowance coverage for total loans has been relatively stable over the past four quarters as credit trends remain generally consistent. Our allowance coverage for our commercial real estate office portfolio has also been relatively stable at approximately 11% for the past several quarters.\nTurning to capital liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11% continue to be well above our current 8.9% regulatory minimum plus buffers. We are also above our expected new CET1 regulatory minimum plus buffers of 9.8% starting in the fourth quarter of this year as our stress capital buffer is expected to increase from 2.9% to 3.8%. We repurchased 6.1 billion of common stock in the second quarter.\nAnd while the pace will slow, we have capacity to continue to repurchase common stock as Charlie highlighted. Also, we expect to increase our common stock dividend in the third quarter by 14% subject to board approval. Turning to our operating segments, starting with consumer banking and lending on Slide 11. Consumer, small, and business banking revenue declined 5% from a year ago, driven by lower deposit balances and the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products.\nTotal lending revenue was down 3% from a year ago due to lower net interest income as loan balances continue to decline. Credit card revenue was stable from a year ago as higher loan balances driven by higher point-of-sale volume new account growth was offset by lower other fee revenue. Auto revenue declined 25% from last year, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression. Personal lending revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and loan spread compression.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 12. Retail mortgage originations declined 31% from a year ago, reflecting our focus on simplifying the home lending business as well as the decline in the mortgage market. Since we announced our new strategy at the start of 2023, we have reduced head count in home lending by approximately 45%. Balances in our auto portfolio declined 14% compared with the year ago, driven by lower origination volumes, which were down 23% from a year ago, reflecting previous credit-tightening actions.\nBoth debit and credit card spend increased from a year ago. Turning to commercial banking results on Slide 13. The middle market banking revenue was down 2% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs, partially offset by growth in treasury management fees. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue decreased 17% year over year, including lower net interest income, lower lease income, and revenue from equity investments.\nAverage loan balances were down 1% compared with a year ago. Loan demand has remained tepid, reflecting the higher for longer rate environment and a market where competition has been more aggressive on pricing and loan structure. Turning to corporate and investment banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 3% from a year ago driven by higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products, partially offset by lower treasury management results driven by the impact of higher interest rates on deposit accounts.\nCommercial real estate revenue was down 4% from a year ago, reflecting the impact of lower loan balances. Markets revenue grew 16% from a year ago, driven by strong performance in equities, structured products, and credit products. Average loans declined 5% from a year ago as growth in markets was more than offset by reductions in commercial real estate where our originations remain muted, and we have strategically reduced balances in our office portfolio, as well as declines in banking where clients continue to access capital goods funding. On Slide 15, wealth and investment management revenue increased 6% compared with a year ago.\nHigher asset-based fees driven by an increase in market valuations were partially offset by lower net interest income, reflecting lower deposit balances and higher deposit costs, as customers reallocated cash into higher yielding alternatives. As a reminder, the majority of WIM and advisory assets are priced at the beginning in the quarter, so the third-quarter results will reflect market valuations as of July 1st, which were up from both a year ago and from April 1st. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results from our venture capital investments.\nTurning to our 2024 outlook for net interest income and noninterest expense on Slide 17. At the beginning of the year, we expected 2024 net interest income to be approximately 7% to 9% lower than full-year 2023. During the first half of this year, the drivers of net interest income largely played out as expected with net interest income down 9% from the same period a year ago. Compared with where we began the year, our current outlook reflects the benefit of fewer rate cuts as well as higher deposit balances in our businesses than what we had assumed in our original expectations, which has helped us reduce market funding.\nDeposit costs increased during the first half of this year as expected, but the pace of the increase has slowed. However, late in the second quarter, we increased pricing in wealth and investment management on sweep deposits and advisory brokerage accounts. This change was not anticipated in our original guidance, better aligns rates with rates paid in money market funds, and is expected to reduce net interest income by approximately $350 million this year. Our current outlook also reflects lower loan balances.\nAt the beginning of the year, we assumed a slight decline in average loans for the full year, which reflected modest growth in commercial and credit card loans in the second half of the year after a slow start to the year. As we highlighted on our first-quarter earnings call, loan balances were weaker than expected, and that trend continued into the second quarter. We expect this underperformance to continue into the second half of the year with loan balances declining slightly from second-quarter levels. As a result of these factors, we currently expect our full-year 2024 net interest income to be in the upper half of the range we provided in January, were down approximately to 9% from full-year 2023.\nWe continue to expect net interest income will trough toward the end of the year. We are only halfway through the year and many of the factors driving net interest income are uncertain, and we will continue to see how each of these assumptions plays out during the remainder of the year. Turning to expenses. At the beginning of this year, we expected our full-year 2024 noninterest expense to be approximately 52.6 billion.\nWe currently expect our full-year 2024 noninterest expense to be approximately 54 billion. There are three primary drivers for this increase. First, the equity markets have outperformed our expectations, driving higher revenue-related compensation expense in wealth and investment management. As a reminder, this is a good thing if these higher expenses were more than offset by higher noninterest income.\nSecond, operating losses and the other customer remediation-related expenses have been higher during the first half of the year than we expected. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year. Finally, we did not anticipate the 336 million of expense in the first half of the year for the FDIC special assessment, which is now included in our updated guidance. We'll continue to update you as the year progresses.\nIn summary, our results in the second quarter reflected the progress we are making to transform Wells Fargo and improve our financial performance. Our strong growth in fee-based businesses offset the expected decline in net interest income. We made further progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our capital position remains strong, enabling us to return excess capital to shareholders, and we continue to make progress on our path to sustainable ROTCE of 15%.\nWe will now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\nAt this time, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please stand by for our first question. Our first question will come from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThanks a lot. Good morning. Mike, I wonder if you could provide a little bit more detail on those latter points you made on the changes on the deposit cost side. First of all, I guess, relative to the 12 basis points that you saw in terms of interest-bearing cost increase, which was lower than the 17, how do you just generally expect that to look going forward? And how -- and is that sweep pricing also a part of what that number will look like going forward? Thank you.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Thanks, Ken. Yes, we mean -- the sweep pricing will be included in that going forward. You saw about -- basically about a month's worth in the quarter, we made the change in June.\nSo, you saw about a third of a quarterly impact already included in the number. Look, I think when you drill into what's going on in the deposit side, I'd say a few things. One, overall -- we're not seeing a lot of pressure on overall pricing in deposits. On the consumer side, this migration that's been happening now for a while from checking into savings or CDs, it's still happening but at a slower pace.\nAnd you can see that over the last couple of years as it's been pretty stable over the last quarter or two, but it's definitely slowing as you look at the quarter. And so, I'd anticipate you'd still see more migration, but continuing to slow as we look forward. On the wholesale side, we -- the pricing has been pretty competitive now for a while, and that's the case. And so, we've been pleased to see that we're able to grow good operational deposits.\nAnd so, given the competitive pricing there, that puts a little near term pressure on NII, but those deposits are going to be very valuable over a long period of time, particularly as rates start to come back down. And so, the positive, I think, overall, as you saw deposits grow in every line of business for the first time in a long time, and that migration is slowing to higher-yielding alternatives. And so, we'll see how it plays out for the rest of the year, but I think there's some good positive trends that are emerging there.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you. And just a follow-up. The fees were really good, and the trading business continues to demonstrate that it's taking market share.\nI guess, how do we understand how to kind of measure that going forward, right, versus what the group is doing? You guys are definitely zigging and outperforming there. Where do you think you are in terms of market share gains, and how sustainable do you think this new kind of run rate of trading is going forward? Thanks.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I'll take that, and Charlie can chime in if he wants. The -- as you look at trading at any given quarter, it's going to bounce around, right? So, you can't necessarily straight line any single quarter. So, I'd be careful there as you look forward.\nBut I think the good part is like we've been methodically sort of making investments in really all of the asset classes, FX, credit to lesser degree in equities and other places, but we're getting the benefit of those investments each quarter on an incremental basis. I think that business is still constrained by the asset cap. And so, we are not growing assets or financing clients assets at the same level we would be if we didn't have the asset cap, which also then drives more trading flow as we go. And so, I'd say we're methodically sort of building it out and there should be opportunity for us to grow that in a prudent way for a while.\nBut any given quarter may bounce around a little bit depending on what's happening in the market or an asset class. And we're getting good reception from clients as we engage with them more and see them move more flow to us.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd this is Charlie. Let me just add a couple of things, which is, as we think about the things that we're doing to invest in our banking franchise, both markets and the investment banking side of the franchise, it's not risk-based. It's actually -- it's focused on customer flows on the trading side. It's focused on expanding coverage and improving product capabilities on the banking side.\nSo, what we look at -- and we're also very, very focused on returns overall, as you can imagine, as all the other large financial institutions are. So, as we're looking at our progress, we do look at share across all the different categories and would expect to see those to continue to tick up. And so, as you look through the volatility that exists in the marketplace, we are looking at a sustained level of growth, recognizing that we don't control the quarter-to-quarter volatility.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK, got it. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. You expressed confidence that NII should bottom toward the year end or toward the back half of this year. Maybe you could just give us what gives you the confidence in maintaining that view just given the loan growth dynamics that you mentioned and you just mentioned the funding cost in the rate backdrop? If you could just kind of walk us through your confidence in that inflection and, I guess, what it could mean as you go into 2025?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. We won't talk much about 2025, John. But as you sort of look at what's happening, you're seeing this pace of migration on the deposit side flow, as I mentioned earlier. So, you're seeing more stability as time goes by there.\nYou're -- once the Fed starts lowering rates, which the market expects to happen later in the year, you'll start to see betas on the way down on the wholesale side of the deposit base. You'll continue to see some gradual sort of repricing on the asset side as you see more securities and more loan sort of roll. And so, you got to look -- exactly calling sort of the trough is which quarter it's going to be, sometimes can be a little tough. But as you sort of look at all the components of it, we still feel pretty good about being able to see that happen over the coming few quarters.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK, thanks. And if I just hop over to capital, buybacks, somebody bought back about 6.1 billion this quarter, similar to the first quarter. You indicated the pace will slow. Maybe if you could give us a little bit of color on how we should think about that moderation and how long that could persist at this point? And how long until you could be back at the run rate you were previously?\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me take a shot at it, Mike, and then you can add the color on this one. Listen, I think when you look at where we've been running capital, we've been trying to anticipate, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the uncertainties that exist around the way we find out about SCB as well as the uncertainty that exists with where Basel III ultimately comes out. The reality of those two things are, we know where the SCB is for this year at this point. We still don't know where Basel III ultimately winds up.\nSo, I think as we sit here today, we will continue -- we'll be conservative on capital return in the shorter term until we learn more about exactly where Basel III will ultimately wind up, and then we can get more specific about what that means for capital returns. So, I just -- I think we're just trying to be very pragmatic. The reality is we're still generating a significant amount of capital and a reasonably sized dividend that's increased as our earnings power has increased. Given the fact that we have constraints, most of what the remainder of our capital generation goes toward capital return, but we want to see where Basel III ultimately winds up.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK, thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\nHey, good morning. Just maybe one follow-up first, Mike and Charlie, on capital. Is 11% the line in the sand right now as you wait for Basel and clarity there as we, at least, you're not guiding for it, but as we think about what the pace of buybacks might be or could CET1 go below 11%, still significant buffer with the 9.6% minimum? Would appreciate how you think about that ratio in the context of capital return.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nI think where we are a plus a little bit, probably not minus a little bit, but plus some is probably the right place to be at this point. Remember, the SCB was higher than we expected. And so, that's factoring into our thinking. And so, that's really what's driving our thinking in terms of slowing the pace of buybacks at this point.\nBut again, hopefully, we'll get some more clarity on Basel III. We know what you know, and then we'll be much clearer about what we think the future looks like there. But again, overall, we still have the capacity to buy back. We just -- as we've always been, we want to be prudent.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\nUnderstood. And then just moving to expenses. So, I get the expense guide increased. But remind us, has anything changed maybe, Charlie, from you first, on the expense flex that's a big part of the wealth thesis around efficiency gains, which should lead to the path for that 15% ROTCE? And what are you baking in in terms of the fee revenue for the back half as part of that guide? Like does it assume elevated levels of trading in IB? Thank you.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nLet me just take the first part. So, just -- and I appreciate you asking the question. I think as far -- from where -- as we look forward, nothing has changed for us as we think about the opportunity to continue to become more efficient. That story is no different today than it was yesterday or last quarter.\nAs we increased the estimates for the year, it's really reflective of three broad categories. One are the variable expenses that relate to our wealth and investment management business where we have higher revenues that results in higher payout. And as Mike always points out, that's actually a good thing, even though it's embedded in the expense line, which causes that number to head upwards. The second thing are the fact that we've had higher customer remediations and FDIC expenses in the first half of the year than when we contemplated the expense guidance.\nOn the customer remediations, we've said it's -- they're not new items, they're historical items. We're getting closer to the end of finalization in these things. And as that occurs, things like response rates and making sure that we've identified every -- the full amount of the population gets all fine-tuned, and that's what's flowing through. But that's a -- it really rates to historical matters and not something that's embedded in what we see in the business going forward.\nSo, what you're left with is the rest of the earnings -- I'm sorry, the expense base of the company, and it's playing out as we would have expected. And so, as we sit here and look forward, all the statements I made in the past are still true, which is, we're not as efficient as we need to be; we're focused on investing in growing the business; we're focused on spending what's necessary to build the right risk and control infrastructure; and we're focused on driving efficiency out of the company. And that lever is -- continues to be exactly what it's been.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\nGot it. And you assume fees staying elevated in the back half as part of the guidance?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. We assume equity markets are about where they are today, so it's still staying pretty elevated.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Analyst\nGot it. Thank you so much.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi, good morning. First, I just want to put context to this question because I didn't want to ask it just in isolation because it seems ticky-tacky, but it's not. So, the stock is down 7.5%. And if I just take consensus to the higher end of your NII range to 9, that would imply that consensus would adjust 3.5% in isolation.\nSo, this is just a context of why I'm asking this question on expenses. So, your expenses went up in terms of -- from your original guide 1.4 billion. I guess -- and you laid out those three bullets, and you quantified FDIC special assessment. I guess I'm just wondering if you could give us a little bit more detail on how much more the remediation expenses and the op losses were up versus your original expectation.\nBecause I think what the market wants to understand is PP -- NII, OK, we get it, that's happening because of deposit repricing. But is core PPNR outside of that going up, right? I just sort of want to have that assurance in terms of is the EPS going to be down as much coming out of this as the market is indicating.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. No, Erika, it's Mike. I appreciate the question. We give you the operating loss line in the supplement.\nSo, you can see that. And if you -- based on what we had said in January, if you assume that the $1.3 billion on a full year basis was just split evenly across all the quarters, you can see that the operating losses are up about $500 million year to date over that run rate. So, that's the way to think about approximately what the impact of that is year to date in the first half.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, then you take that, you add the FDIC to it.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nRight. And the remainder is roughly the revenue-related expenses in wealth management.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo that's why, Erika, when I was talking before, when you look at what's driving the increase in the expense guide, it is -- its remediations in the first and second quarter. It's the FDIC expense that you've seen, and it's the increase in variable expenses. Everything else is playing out as we would have expected.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. OK. That makes sense. And just maybe some comments on how you're thinking about credit quality from here.\nIt looks like you continue to release reserves in the second quarter. Is this a message that you feel like you've captured most of the CRE-related issues, of course, absent of a further deterioration in the economy? And how should we think about the trajectory of the reserves from here relative to your charge-offs?\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, when you say -- well, I think when we look at the reserves, you have to bucket into different pieces. Our exposures are coming down in parts of the consumer business and are -- based on underwriting changes we've made, it's not just balances, but also the actual losses. So, that's what's driving the reductions in that part of the loss reserves on the consumer side. And on the credit card side, it's really driven -- the increase is really driven by balances.\nSo, you've got two very different dynamics going on there, with the releases being just representative of a smaller, higher credit quality credit portfolio. And then on the wholesale side, we're -- the losses that we've seen and the credit performance in our CIB office CRE portfolio is playing out no worse than we would have expected when we set our ACL, but there's still uncertainty there. So, we're maintaining the coverage. So, overall, there's really -- in terms of our expectations, no real change from what we're seeing in the CRE portfolio, which is where the loss content is actually coming through.\nAnd elsewhere, things are still fairly benign other than some episodic credit events in part of the wholesale business, but no real trend there.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you, Charlie and Mike.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open, sir.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. Can you just elaborate a bit on why you increased the deposit cost for wealth? Was it to keep up with competition? Or is it trying to get ahead of some potential pricing pressures? What was kind of the logic there?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Hey, it's Mike, Matt. So, this was very specific to a sweep product in the wealth business. So, it's a portion of that overall deposits, and it doesn't have any bearing on any other products.\nSo, I would leave with that very specific to that one individual product in fiduciary accounts or advisory accounts.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. And how big is that, those deposit balances?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nWe didn't -- we don't -- that's not something we normally have out there. But you can see the impact is -- I sort of highlighted the impact is roughly $350 million for the rest of the year for the second half of the year. So, I would just use that as -- and that's already embedded in sort of the guidance we gave.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. And then just a separate topic here. I mean the credit card growth has been very good. You highlighted rolling out some new products.\nAnd the question is always when you -- anyway growth kind of still makes sense in certain category, even if they are not growing too quickly. The loss rates have gone up maybe a little more than some peers, not as much as from others, obviously in line with what you were targeting. There was that negative Wall Street Journal article on one of your cards. So, just kind of taken together, what kind of checks and balances you have to make sure that a somewhat new initiative for you that you're growing at the right pace? Thank you.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYes. So, Mike, I'll start, and then you can chime in. So, first of all, we -- when we look at our credit card performance, we do not look at it in total, right? We look at each individual product. We look at all of the performance broken out by vintage.\nAnd we compare the results that we're seeing, both in terms of balance build as well as credit performance, not losses, but starting very early with early on books delinquencies. And we look at how they're playing out versus pre-pandemic results as well as what we would have anticipated when we launched the product. As I said, we look at the actual quality of the consumers that we're underwriting and the overall credit quality. We haven't compromised credit quality at all.\nWe've probably tightened up a little bit as time has gone on relative to where we had been, but the actual performance when you look at the vintages is it's really spot on with what we would have expected. So, what you're seeing in terms of the increase in loss rates is just the maturing of the portfolio. And the last thing I'll just say is just when you think about the Wall Street Journal article, that -- we've launched a lot -- a bunch of new credit cards. That is a -- relative to the size and the scope of all of the cards that we issue and what our strategy is, that's a very, very, very small piece of it.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. And I would just add one piece. As you look at new account growth, we're not originating anything less than 660. So, as Charlie mentioned, some of the credit tightening with 660 FICO, sorry.\nSo, as Charlie mentioned, the credit box has not been brought in really at all. And when you look at some of the bigger products like cash back -- the cash back card, active cash, the new originations are coming in at a higher credit quality than the back book was. And so, at this point, as Charlie said, we go through it at a very, very granular level each quarter, and results are kind of right where we expect. And if we start to see any kind of weakness at all, we're adjusting where needed.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAnd just one last comment here, which is again because I appreciate the question. Whatever -- it's -- whenever you see a lot of growth in a product that has risk in it, it's always the right thing to ask the questions. We're not -- this isn't -- the people that are doing this, both in our card business, Kleber who runs consumer lending, myself, like this is not a new product for us. We've seen this happen in the past, we've seen people do this well, and we've seen people not do this well.\nAnd so, we're very, very conscious of the risks that you're pointing out as we go forward just as we are on the other businesses that we're investing in.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. That's helpful. And obviously, you talked about card losses going down in 3Q. So, it's consistent with what you said as well.\nSo, thank you for the color.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nYep. Absolutely.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi, good morning.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nSo, I just wanted to make sure on the expense guide, I get the point that a bunch of that is related to better revenues from wealth management. And so, we should be anticipating, as a part of that, that revenues for wealth management in the second half is going to be at least at one-half or maybe even a little higher. Is that fair?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, Betsy, I covered that in my script, too. So, as you look at the advisory assets there, they get priced based on -- and most of them get priced in advance for the quarter. So, you know what third quarter looks like based on where we are now.\nAnd obviously, it's not all equity market. There's some fixed income in there as well. But you should see a little bit of an increase as you go into the third quarter based on where the markets are now, and then we'll see what the fourth quarter looks like when we get there.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nYeah, OK. So, I just wanted to make sure we balanced out the expenses with the rev beat. I know you're not guiding revs up but interpretation leads you down that path. And so, then I guess the other piece of the question I had just had to relate with, the loan balance discussion that was going on earlier.\nAnd what's your view of interest in leaning into the markets business today? I realize there's opportunity. There's still the asset cap constraint, but you're not at the asset cap. So, there is room for you to lean in. There are players who are a little bit more constrained on capital than you even in that space.\nSo, is this an area that you would be interested in leaning into, especially when C&I and CRE and other types of loans are low demand right now, as you indicated earlier? Thanks.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nWell, let me start. I think -- so, first of all, relative to where the balance sheet is running, we're not -- let me say we want to -- we're careful about how we run the overall balance sheet, right, which is we don't want to operate at the cap on a regular basis because you've got to be prepared both for customer appetite in terms of lending and deposits when you see it as well as we lived through COVID where there was an event. And all of a sudden, there were a bunch of draws, and we have to live within that asset cap. So, running it with the cushion is a very smart thing, we think, for us to do, even though you can argue we're giving up some shorter-term profit.\nSo, that's just the reality of where we live. And so, as we think about the markets business and what that means, in the perfect world, we'd be allowing them to finance some more. There are more opportunities out there for us to be able to do that. But what we are doing is, as we think about inside the company, optimizing the balance sheet and where we get the most returns and where there's more demand and less demand.\nThere has been less demand in other parts of the company, and there's been more demand on the trading side. So, our assets are actually up 15-ish percent.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. Trading -- if you go to the supplement deck, trading assets on an average basis are up 17%, a little more on a spot basis.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSo, we're just trying to -- so, we're reflective of what those opportunities are, but we've got to keep capacity for the reasons I mentioned.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nGot it. OK, thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Charlie, you mentioned in your opening comments about Fargo.\nYou guys launched Fargo over a year ago, I guess, and you're having real good pickup. Can you share with us any other AI-orientated programs that are in work in progress right now that could lead to increased efficiencies or cost savings or even revenue enhancements as you go forward?\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nSure. As we first -- when we think about AI, we do break it into different categories, right? There is traditional AI and then there is GenAI. We have a huge number of use cases already embedded across the company with just traditional AI. And that is -- it's in marketing, it's in credit decisioning, it's in information that we provide bankers on both the wholesale, on the consumer side about what customers could be willing or might be willing to entertain a discussion about.\nAnd so, that is -- in a lot of respects, that's business as usual for us. The new opportunity that exists with GenAI is where AI creates something based upon whether it's public data on our own data in terms of things that haven't existed. We are most focused in the shorter term on things that can drive efficiency. But it also contributes to just quality of the experience for our customers.\nSo, great examples of things like that are call centers. We take lots of phone calls, and we've got lots of opportunities through AI to answer those questions before someone gets to a call center rep. But once they get to a call center rep, we put a lot of effort into answering that question correctly but also making sure that we're capturing that information, understanding root cause across all these calls we get. That means bankers have to go -- telephone bankers have to go in, actually enter what the call was about, what they think the root cause is.\nWe then have to aggregate that and so on and so forth. Through GenAI, that can be done automatically. It could be done immediately, and the work can be done for us to identify that root cause so then we can go back, look at it, and make sure that's the case and make the change. So, ultimately, that results in fixing defects going forward, but it also takes so much manual effort out of what we do.\nAnd so, that's -- and so, any place where something is written, something is analyzed by an individual, we've got the opportunity to automate that. Those things exist on the wholesale side as well as the consumer side. To the extent that they impact a consumer, we're going to move very slowly to make sure we understand the impact of that. And so, the work is a meaningful part of as we think about prioritization in terms of our tech spend.\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\nVery good. I appreciate those insights. And then just as a quick follow-up, you also mentioned about improved advisor retention in the quarter. And when you look at your wealth and investment management segment, I recognize commissions and brokerage service fees are not the main driver in investment advisory and other asset-based fees are in revenues for this division.\nBut I noticed that they've been flat to down this year. They're up over a year ago. Is it seasonal in the second quarter that that line of business just gets soft? Or is it the higher rate environment where customers are just leaving more cash in -- more assets in cash because they're getting 5% or so?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. There really is no rhyme or reason necessarily, Gerard, to exactly how that moves one quarter to the next necessarily. Obviously, if there's like large bouts of volatility, you might see more transaction activity. That certainly hasn't been the case necessarily in the equity market in the second quarter.\nBut to some degree, as that line item over a very long period of time, that line item probably declines more and advisory goes up. And that's actually a really good thing from a productivity and from an ongoing revenue perspective as well.\nGerard Cassidy -- Analyst\nYep. OK, super. OK, appreciate it. Thank you, Mike.\nOperator\nAnd our final question for today will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\nThanks. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. Just given the sheer amount of, I guess, investor questions that we've received on the deposit pricing changes in wealth, I was hoping you could provide some additional context given many of your peers have talked about cash sorting pressures abating or at least being in the very late innings.\nAnd I want to better understand what informed the decision to adjust your pricing? Was it impacting advisor recruitment or retention? Was it impeding your ability to retain more share of wallet? And -- or is this an effort to maybe go on the offensive and lead the market on pricing and sweep deposits and force others to potentially follow suit?\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Steve. It's Mike. I'd say just a couple of things. One, this is not in reaction to cash sorting.\nWe are seeing cash sorting slow in the wealth business just like we're seeing that in the consumer business. So, this is not a reaction to that in any way. It's a relatively small portion of the overall deposits that sit within the wealth business. And it is very specific to this product, which is in an advisory account where there's frictional cash there.\nSo, it's not a reaction to competitive forces that we're seeing or us trying to be proactive somewhere to drive growth.\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\nUnderstood. And just one follow-up on the discussion relating to expenses. And just given the fee momentum that you're seeing within CIB and wealth, and you're clearly making investments in both of those segments, at the same time, the incremental margins have actually been quite high, especially in CIB, where it's running north of 75% just first half this year versus last. I was hoping to get some perspective as we think about some of that fee momentum being sustained what do you believe are sustainable or durable incremental margins within CIB and wealth recognizing the payout profiles are different.\nMichael P. Santomassimo -- Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nWell, let me start on the wealth side, and I'll come back to the iBanking or banking side. So, on the wealth side, what's really going to help us drive margin expansion in that business over time are really kind of two things. One is continued productivity and growth in the advisory asset side, which you can see happening. And then two, and we've talked about this in other forums, it's doing a much better job penetrating that client base with banking and lending products.\nSo, when you look at our loans in the wealth business and you look at the overall asset base or the advisor for us, we're much less penetrated than some of the peers. And so, I think those things really help drive us to get to more best-in-class margins, which are higher than where we sit today. And that takes some time. On the lending side, in this rate environment, it's a little harder to drive that growth.\nAnd as rates start to come down, you'll probably see more demand there. And so, there are some cyclical aspects of it that sort of come to from a timing perspective. But those are things that the Barry Sommers and the whole management team in wealth are very focused on and making sure we've got the right capabilities, the right sales force, the right support for the sales force, and so forth. On the iBanking side, we've been making investments in that business now for the better part of two-plus years, a little longer than that probably.\nAnd as we're adding good people, we're also -- not necessary -- we're also making sure that we've got the right people in the right seats. And so, you're not seeing this really huge increase in overall senior headcount. You're actually -- we're making sure we got the right people in the right seats. And so, you've seen some reductions as you've seen some growth.\nAnd so, that's helping also moderate the overall investment. And then also, as we brought those people on, you're paying them full freight when you recruit people, right? So, what you're seeing is, you're getting the benefit of those investments by adding the revenue piece now, but you've already got the expense and the run rate to some degree. And so, I think you'll see that pace of margin expansion moderate over time, but what you're seeing is what you should expect, which is like we made the investments, you're paying the people now they're becoming productive incrementally each quarter, and that's good to see.\nSteven Chubak -- Analyst\nThat's really helpful color, Mike. Thanks for taking my questions.\nCharles William Scharf -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nAll right, everyone. Thanks very much.

[Operator Instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell — Director of Investor Relations\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf, and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo will discuss first quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck, are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website.\nI will now turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results and update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review first quarter results in more detail before we take your questions.\nLet me start with some first quarter highlights. Our results in the quarter were strong and reflected the continued progress we're making to improve returns. We grew revenue from both the fourth quarter and a year ago. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives and expenses declined from both the fourth quarter and a year ago, driven by lower operating losses, but we continue to be focused on controlling other expenses as well.\nThe consumer, and majority of our businesses remained strong. Delinquencies and net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase as expected. We're looking for signs of accelerated deterioration in asset classes or segments of our customers. And broadly speaking, we saw little change in the trends from the prior quarter, however, weakness continues to develop in commercial real estate office, and Mike will discuss this in more detail. Given what we're seeing, we're taking incremental actions to tighten credit on higher risk segments, but continue to lend broadly. We increased our allowance for credit losses for the fourth consecutive quarter. Our economic expectations used to support the allowance have not changed meaningfully. But we do continue to look at specific asset classes such as commercial real estate to appropriately assess the adequacy of the allowance. We will continue to monitor the trends in each of our loan portfolios to determine the future action is warranted.\nBoth commercial and consumer average loans were up from a year ago, but were relatively stable from the fourth quarter. Consumer spending remained strong with growth in both debit and credit card spend, but spending began to soften late in the quarter. The decline in average deposits that started a year ago continued in the first quarter, primarily driven by customers seeking higher-yielding alternatives and continued growth in consumer spending. We did see some moderate inflows from the few specific banks that have been highlighted in the press, but those inflows have abated. Our CET1 ratio, which was already strong, increased to 10.8%, even as we resumed common stock repurchases in the first quarter, buying back $4 billion in common stock.\nLet me share some thoughts on the recent market events impacting the banking industry. We're glad that the work we have completed over the last several years has put us in a position to help support the U.S. financial system. Along with 10 other large banks, we utilized our strength and liquidity and we made a $5 billion uninsured deposit into First Republic Bank, reflecting our confidence in the country's banking system and to help provide First Republic with liquidity to continue serving its customers. I'm proud of everything our employees have done during this historic period to be there for our customers. We believe banks of all sizes are important part of our financial system as each is uniquely positioned to serve their customers and communities. It's important to recognize that banks have different operating models and that the banks that failed in the first quarter were quite different from what people think of when they think about the typical regional bank. These particular banks had concentrated business models with heavy reliance on uninsured deposits. Our franchise and those of many other banks operate with the broader business model and more diversified funding sources. It is times like these that the many benefits of our own franchise become even more clear. Our diversified business model provides opportunities to serve our customers broadly, which reduces concentration risks across the different elements of risks. Most importantly, our customers benefit from our size and the range of banking services we provide, which helps us build a full relationship with individuals and companies. We also have strong capital and liquidity positions, which include a mix of deposits and access to multiple funding sources and our continued focus on financial and credit risk management allows us to support our customers throughout economic cycles.\nNow let me update you on the progress we've made on our strategic priorities. Our top priority remains building out our risk and control framework appropriate for our company. I spent time in my recent annual letter highlighting why we remain confident in our ability to complete this work, including having much more effective reporting and processes in place to provide appropriate oversight, adding close to 10,000 people across numerous risk and control related groups as part of our commitment to make the investments needed to complete more and building the management disciplines and culture to govern and execute the work, which includes the operating committee reviewing risks and regulatory progress and escalations on a weekly basis.\nI also summarize the actions we've taken to simplify the way we operate. This work continued in the first quarter as we largely completed the exit of the correspondent home lending business as part of our plans to simplify that business. We are also narrowing our retail mortgage business to focus on predominantly bank customers and underserved communities. Our strategy includes broadening our existing investment from the special-purpose credit program to include purchase loans, investing an additional $100 million to advance racial equity in home ownership and deploying additional home mortgage consultants in local minority communities.\nWe continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions. We announced a multi-year agreement with Choice Hotels to launch new co-branded credit card this month, creating a best-in-class credit card program designed to enhance our customers' experience and bring them more value. We rolled out early payday late last year, which makes eligible direct deposits available up to two days early. In the first quarter, this enhancement provided customers early access to over $200 billion in direct deposits. We launched Flex Loan in the fourth quarter, a digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds. Customer response continues to exceed our expectations. We've originated over 100,000 loans since November.\nDigital adoption and usage among our consumer customers continued to increase. We added over 500,000 mobile active customers in the first quarter and digital logins increased 6% from a year ago. Since rolling out Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients, late last year, we received overwhelmingly positive feedback on the new user experience. Vantage uses AI and machine-learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform, based on our clients' specific needs.\nWe also continue to make progress on our environmental, social and governance work. We announced a $50 million grant to the NAACP to support efforts to advance racial equity in America. This is the single largest donation that the NAACP has ever received from corporation and builds on our longstanding relationship with the NAACP that spans more than 20 years. The Wells Fargo foundation expanded its commitment to housing affordability, there were another $20 million housing affordability breakthrough challenge to advance ideas to help meet the need for more affordable homes across the country. We also announced a $20 million commitment to advance economic opportunities in Native American communities including addressing housing, small business, financial health and sustainability.\nBefore concluding, I wanted to highlight the management changes we announced yesterday. Mary Mack, the CEO of Consumer and Small Business Banking is retiring this summer. She spent her entire career at Wells Fargo and has led Consumer and Small Business Banking for the past seven years through significant amount of change, including defining a new path forward for the business. I can think of few Wells Fargo colleagues who have done as much for our company and have been as visible in the communities that we serve over such a long period of time.\nWe also announced that Saul Van Beurden, Head of Technology, Wells Fargo, will succeed Mary. Saul is a strong leader, a technologist, and he knows how to run a business. This makes him the ideal person to lead Consumer and Small Business Banking into the future. Our branch network will continue to be the key to business — to the business, but our customers expect us to provide them with increasingly digitized and seamless banking experiences across all channels. Saul understands this deeply and has consistently proven his ability to convert new products and services across Wells Fargo.\nFinally, Tracy Kerrins, currently Head of Consumer Technology, will become Head of Technology for the company reporting to me. Tracy has worked in the technology and finance industry for more than 20 years and has led to a series of business-critical initiatives to modernize our technology platforms across our consumer businesses. She's a strong results-driven leader. It's always great when we can tap our own leaders for roles within the company and I want to thank Mary for everything she's done during her tenure at Wells Fargo. It's truly been a pleasure working with her.\nAs we look forward, we're carefully watching customer behavior for clues on how the economic environment is changing. Customer activity is still relatively strong and delinquencies remain low though they are increasing. There are pockets of risks such as commercial office real estate, which will likely impact institutions differently and we are proactively managing our own exposures. We continue to expect economic growth to slow and we are prepared for a range of scenarios. We will continue to monitor both the markets and our customers and we'll react accordingly. Our diversified business model should enable us to support our customers throughout economic cycles.\nI will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone.\nNet income for the first quarter was $5 billion or $1.23 per diluted common share. While there was a lot going on in the banking industry around us, we continue to focus on our priorities and our results reflected the progress we're making, which I'll highlight throughout the call. Starting with capital and liquidity on Slide three, our CET1 ratio was 10.8%, up approximately 20 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting our earnings in the quarter and lower risk-weighted assets. After pausing share repurchases for the prior three quarters, we repurchased $4 billion of common stock in the first quarter. Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers and we expect to continue to prudently return excess capital to shareholders in the coming quarters. In the first quarter, our liquidity coverage ratio was approximately 22 percentage points above the regulatory minimum. We continue to benefit from a diversified deposit base with over 60% of our deposits in our Consumer Banking and Lending segment as of the first quarter, which is a higher percentage than before the pandemic.\nTurning to credit quality on Slide five. Net loan charge-offs continue to slowly increase to 26 basis points in the first quarter, but we're still below pre-pandemic levels. Commercial net loan charge-offs decreased $16 million from the fourth quarter to five basis points. However, while losses improved, we continue to see some gradual weakening in underlying credit performance, including higher nonperforming assets. We are proactively monitoring our clients' sensitivity to inflation and higher rates and are taking appropriate actions when warranted. We are also closely monitoring our commercial real estate office portfolio, and I'll share some more details on our exposure on the next slide.\nAs expected, we've seen consumer delinquencies and losses gradually increase. Total consumer net loan charge-offs increased $60 million from the fourth quarter to 56 basis points of average loans, driven by an increase in the credit card portfolio. While most consumers remained resilient, we've seen some consumer financial health trends gradually weakening from a year ago and we continue to take credit tightening actions position the portfolio for a slowing economy. Nonperforming assets increased 7% from the fourth quarter, driven by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans over down 12% from a year ago due to lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans. Of note, 87% of the nonaccrual loans in our commercial real estate portfolio were current on interest and 75% were current on both principal and interest as of the end of the first quarter.\nOur allowance for credit losses increased $643 million in the first quarter reflecting an increase for commercial real estate loans primarily office loans as well as an increase for credit card model loans. Given the increased focus on commercial real estate loans, especially office, we provided more details on our portfolio on Slide six. We had $154.7 billion of commercial real estate loans outstanding at the end of the first-quarter with 35.7 [Phonetic] of office loans, which represented 4% of our total loans outstanding. The office market continues to show signs of weakness due to lower demand, higher financing costs in challenging capital market conditions. While we haven't seen this translate to meaningful loss content yet, we expect to see more stress over time. As you would expect, we have been derisking the office portfolio, which resulted in commitments, declining 5% from a year ago and we continue to proactively work with borrowers to manage our exposure, including structural enhancements and paydowns as warranted.\nAs you can see on this slide, we provide some additional data on the office portfolio, including approximately 12% owner-occupied, therefore the loan performance is mostly tied to the cash flow of the owner's operating business rather than rents paid by tenants, nearly one-third have recoursed to the guarantor typically through repayment guarantee. The portfolio is geographically diverse and as you'd expect, the largest concentrations are in California and New York. Over two-thirds of our office loans are in the corporate investment banking business and the vast majority of this portfolio is institutional-quality real estate with high-caliber sponsors. While approximately 80% of it's Class A, keep in mind that this is a single measure that it's hard to evaluate in isolation, for example, newer or refurbished properties may perform better regardless of whether they are Class A or B. We are providing this data to give you more insight into the portfolio, but as is usually the case in commercial real estate, each property situation is different in a myriad of other variables such as leasing rates, loan-to-value and debt yields can determine performance, which is why we regularly review the portfolio on a loan-by-loan basis.\nAs a result of market conditions and the recent increases in criticized assets and non-accrual loans, we've increased our allowance for credit losses for office loans for the past four quarters. The allowance for credit losses coverage ratio at the end of the first quarter for the office portfolio in the corporate investment bank was 5.7%. We will continue to closely monitor this portfolio, but as has been the case in prior cycles, this will likely play out over an extended period of time as we actively work with borrowers to help resolve issues they may be facing.\nOn Slide seven, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 6% from a year ago and were relatively stable from the fourth quarter, while period-end loans declined 1% from the fourth quarter with lower balances across our consumer and commercial portfolios. I'll highlight the specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 244 basis points from a year ago and 56 basis points from the fourth quarter, reflecting the higher interest rate environment. Average deposits declined 7% from a year ago and 2% from the fourth quarter due to the consumer deposit outflows as customers continue to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives and continued spending.\nDuring the market stress last month, we experienced a brief increase in deposit inflows that has since abated, and while our period-end deposit balances were slightly higher than we expected at the beginning of the quarter, were still down 2% from the fourth quarter. As expected, our average deposit cost increased 37 basis points from the fourth quarter to 83 basis points with higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Our mix of non-interest bearing deposits declined from 35% in the fourth quarter to 32% in the first quarter, but remain above pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to net interest income on Slide eight. First quarter net interest income was $13.3 billion, which was 45% higher than a year ago as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. The $97 million decline for the fourth quarter was due to two fewer business days. Our full-year net interest income guidance has not changed from last quarter, as we still expect 2023 net interest income to grow by approximately 10% compared with 2022. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn this year will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix and repricing and loan demand.\nTurning to expenses on Slide nine. Non-interest expense declined 1% from a year ago, driven by lower operating losses and the impact of the business unit sales. The increase in personnel expense from the fourth quarter was driven by approximately $650 million of seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement eligible employees and 401k matching contributions. Our full-year 2023 noninterest expense, excluding operating losses, is still expected to be approximately $2.2 billion, unchanged from the guidance we provided last quarter. As a reminder, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses.\nTurning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 10. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 28% from a year ago as higher net interest income driven by the impact of higher interest rates was partially offset by lower deposit-related fees driven by the overdraft policy changes we rolled out last year. We are continuing to make investments in this business, we're beginning to increase marketing spend, we're accelerating the efforts to renovate and refurbish our branches for our bankers, we're investing in new tools and capabilities to provide better and more personalized advice to customers, we're continuing to enhance our mobile app and mobile active users were up 4% year-over-year, and we're also seeing increased activity and positive initial indicators after our rollout of Wells Fargo Premier last year. It's early on for all of these initiatives, but we're starting to see some green shoots. At the same time, we continue to execute on our efficiency initiatives. Teller transactions continue to decline with reduced headcount — we reduced headcount by 9% and total branches were down 4% from a year ago.\nIn Home Lending, mortgage rates remained elevated and the mortgage market continued to decline. Our Home Lending revenue declined 42% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations including a significant decline in the correspondent channel and lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools. We continue to reduce headcount in the first quarter and we expect staffing levels will continue to decline due to the strategic changes we announced earlier this year. We stopped accepting applications from the correspondent channel as announced in January and began to reduce the complexity and the size of the servicing book.\nDuring the first quarter, we successfully marketed mortgage servicing rights for approximately $50 billion of loans serviced for others that we expect to close later this year. We will continue to look for additional opportunities to simplify and reduce the size of our servicing business. Credit card revenue increased 3% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, driven by higher point-of-sale volume. Other revenue declined 12% from a year ago, driven by lower loan balances and continued loan spread compression from credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates. Personal Lending revenue was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances.\nTurning to some key business drivers on Slide 11. Mortgage originations declined 83% from a year ago and 55% from the fourth quarter with declines in both correspondent and retail originations. As I mentioned, we stopped accepting correspondent applications in January. So going forward, our originations will be focused on serving Wells Fargo customers in underserved communities. The size of our auto portfolios declined for four consecutive quarters and balances were down 8% at the end of the first quarter compared to a year ago. Origination volume declined 32% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions and continued price competition.\nDebit card spending increased 2% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, an increase from the 1% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter, discretionary spending drove the growth with non-discretionary spending stable from the fourth quarter levels. Credit card spending increased 16% from a year ago, in line with the year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter with sustained growth in both discretionary and non-discretionary spending. Spending growth slowed throughout the quarter, but was still at double-digit levels in March. We continue to see some slight moderation in payment rates in the first quarter, but they were still well above pre-pandemic levels.\nTurning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 12. Middle-market banking revenue grew by 73% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances, while deposit-related fees were lower, reflecting higher earnings credit rates on non-interest bearing deposits. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue increased 7% year-over-year, driven by loan growth which was partially offset by lower net gains from equity securities. Average loan balances were up 15% in the first quarter compared to a year ago, driven by new customer growth and higher line utilization. After being stable in the second half of last year, line utilization increased slightly in the first quarter. Average loan balances have grown for seven consecutive quarters and were up 2% from the fourth quarter with growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory. Growth in middle-market banking was once again driven by larger clients, including both new and existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller clients.\nTurning to Corporate Investment Banking on Slide 13. Banking revenue increased 37% from a year ago, driven by stronger treasury management results, reflecting the impact of higher interest rates. Investment management — investment banking fees declined from a year-ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all major products in nearly all industries. While commercial real estate market transactions are down across the industry, our commercial real estate revenue grew 32% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates and higher loan balances. Markets revenue increased 53% from a year ago, driven by higher trading results across all asset classes. Average loans grew 4% from a year ago, but were down from the fourth quarter, lower balances of banking reflected a combination of slow demand, increased payoffs and relatively stable line utilization. The decline in commercial real estate balances were driven by the higher rate environment and lower commercial real estate sales volumes.\nOn Slide 14, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was down 2% compared to a year ago, driven by lower asset-based fees due to lower market valuations. Growth in net interest income was driven by the impact of higher rates, which was partially offset by lower deposit balances as customers continued to reallocate cash into higher-yielding alternatives. At the end of the first quarter, cash alternatives were approximately 12% of total client assets, up from approximately 4% a year ago. Expenses decreased 4% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives. Average loans were down 1% from a year ago, primarily due to a decline in securities based lending.\nSlide 15 highlights our corporate results, revenue declined $103 million or 83% from a year ago as higher net interest income was more than offset by lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses. Results in the first quarter included $342 million of net losses on equity securities or $223 million pre-tax and net of non-controlling interests.\nIn summary, our results in the first quarter reflect an improvement in our earnings capacity. We grew revenue and reduced expenses and had strong growth in pre-tax, pre-provision profits. As expected, our net charge-offs have continued to slowly increase from historical lows and we are closely monitoring our portfolios, taking credit tightening actions where appropriate. Our capital levels grew, even as we resumed common stock repurchases and we expect repurchases to continue. And the guidance we provided last quarter for full-year 2023, net interest income and expenses excluding operating losses has not changed.\nWe will now take your questions.\nQuestions and Answers:\nOperator\nWe will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question for today will come from Scott Siefers of Piper Sandler. Your line is open.\nScott Siefers — Piper Sandler — Analyst\nMorning. Thank you for taking the question. Mike, I was hoping to just start out on the deposit side. So when you talk about the influx of deposits from some of the sort of special situations having abated, did anybody actually leave the bank or is it just sort of the inflows that have stopped?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah the — hey, Scott, thanks for the question. Look, the inflows stopped right and they came in, in a pretty short period of time and those inflows stopped. I think what you're seeing since then is just normal spending on the consumer side and normal activity across the other businesses.\nScott Siefers — Piper Sandler — Analyst\nOkay, perfect. And then. I guess maybe switch gears, just a bit. I think in your prepared remarks, you discussed plans to sort of prudently return excess capital in coming quarters. It was very glad to see the resumption in repurchasing in the first quarter, but just given all the kind of cross currents that we've got, whether it's uncertainty on the regulatory environment or uncertainty in the economy, kind of countered against your very strong capital levels. Just curious where maybe a little more color on how you would be thinking about share repurchase in the — through the remainder of the year?\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, this is Charlie. Let me take a stab. I would say, listen, I think the way we feel about it is, our capital levels grew quarter-over-quarter even after we purchased the $4 billion of stock. So it just shows our ability to generate capital if necessary, because of the environment or regulatory changes or things like that. So because of that, we do feel like we have the ability to continue to return capital to shareholders, while we still have plenty of flexibility to deal with anything which could come our way, and so our excess above the regulatory minimum plus buffers is extremely high beyond what we feel that it needs to be. So we think we can continue to address that and still be very prudent with how we manage capital.\nScott Siefers — Piper Sandler — Analyst\nWonderful. Okay. I have a bunch of more questions, but I have a feeling they'll be asked going forward as well. So, Charlie, Mike, thank you guys very much. Really appreciate it.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open sir.\nSteven Chubak — Wolfe Research — Analyst\nHey, good morning. So wanted to get a little bit more granular on some of the expense trends that we're seeing, we've gone through the exercise of benchmarking your segment efficiency ratios versus peers. Clearly, you've made significant strides, improving profitability across virtually every segment, Commercial, CIB and Wealth, the PP&L, our margins are running really in line with the peer group, it's still the consumer efficiency ratio in the mid 60s, which is running well above peers and I was hoping you could just speak to the opportunity on the expense side within consumer, how much of a benefit should you see from the retrenchment in mortgage and maybe what do you see as a normalized efficiency target for the segment, just given your current mix of business?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nHey Steve. It's Mike, I'll start and Charlie can chime in if he wants to. I think when you think about consumer. I think we still have a lot more work to do there. And it's both in the consumer lending space, the mortgage space, as we simplify the servicing side of that business and that just takes a little bit of time to work its way through, needs to be thoughtful and in some cases, requires a little bit of investment in technology and the like. And then on the consumer banking side, we've continued to rationalize the branch footprint and branch setup. We continue to see teller transactions and other things decline and so I think you'll see us focus there and what hopefully what you've seen in that segment is a consistent quarter-on-quarter decline in headcount and other factors. And that will sort of continue to hopefully be the case. And then when you think about just where the end state is, we shouldn't look any different than our peers, our best-in-class peers for each of our segments, including that one. So over a period of time, that's the goal.\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I would just add, when you look at our — that segment, we obviously — mix versus other people is an issue. Our Home Lending business is today extremely inefficient, which is part of the reason why we made the decision that we made. So we've got a lot of wood to chop there which will play out over a period of time to make that business more efficient. And as we've talked about on the consumer banking side, we've done I think you know for many, many years after Mary got her job in consumer banking operation, our focus was dealing with the cleanup, which they've done an exceptional job in the consumer and small business bank about. And then turned our attention to becoming more efficient, which she has worked really hard on, and that's a combination of looking at our branch footprint, staffing within the branches, migrating people to digital and we're behind on that, but there has been a lot of progress made over the last year and a half to two years. And so there's still a tremendous amount of opportunity there, but it's in flight.\nSteven Chubak — Wolfe Research — Analyst\nReally helpful color. Just for my follow-up, wanted to unpack some of the NII trends that we're seeing within the Wealth side specifically. And there's a big focus right now on yield-seeking behavior if the higher for longer rate environment persists. You and your peers have seen contraction in NII sequentially, and continued deposit outflows. Was hoping you could speak to whether you're seeing any abatement in just the pace of cash sorting or yield-seeking behavior as of yet or if it's continued at a pretty healthy clip?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, I'll take that, and you know, when you look at the sequential change in NII, it's really the two fewer days in the quarter that drove it. Otherwise, it's pretty flat to the fourth quarter as we thought it would be when we talked in January. When you think about, well, it's been pretty stable the trend, it's not accelerating, it's not decelerating at any significant clip at this point. And what we see there is we're capturing that cash — those cash alternatives that people are buying in the Wealth business and so — so I think that trend will continue for a while. And the good news is we're capturing that in other ways, but the trend has been pretty stable. That's probably going to be the case for a little longer.\nSteven Chubak — Wolfe Research — Analyst\nHelpful color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open.\nJohn McDonald — Autonomous Research — Analyst\nHi, good morning. Mike, I was wondering what your outlook is for the second quarter NII, maybe you could talk a little bit about the puts and takes to that and what you're thinking for second quarter? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, John, as you look at, as things are trending, you can see where deposits are on a period-end and average basis, that's probably input number one, and then you can see that deposit yields have increased rates, so those two things are going to be the biggest drivers, so you should expect a little bit of a step-down from Q1 into Q2 and then we'll see exactly sort of what that looks like, as we get a little bit Into the quarter, but I think the variables are there to kind of come up with a range of outcomes.\nJohn McDonald — Autonomous Research — Analyst\nYeah, okay, and the outlook for the full year obviously embeds a pretty big step-down from the first quarter starting point. Can you give us any more color about the types of assumptions you have embedded into the full-year outlook on deposit flows, mix shift and reprice beta?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. And as we've talked over the last few quarters are sold, a ton of uncertainty out there with regards to really all the inputs that go into that, right. And whether it's the mix of deposits, the absolute level or where pricing will be and so our guide assumes that it's still going to be a pretty competitive space for deposits on the pricing side that we will still see some mix-shift happening and that we'll see some moderate declines as people continue to spend and the trends happen and so as we talked about even last quarter. I think we'll get as time goes by, we get more and more information, and so we're hopeful that there is upside to the forecast, but we'll see that in the second half of the year and it will be a function of how all those factors play out, but we're hopeful that we'll see that and there'll be some upside there.\nJohn McDonald — Autonomous Research — Analyst\nOkay, thanks.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nKen Usdin — Jefferies — Analyst\nHey, good morning. I just wanted to ask a follow-up on the cost side, so I think we're all pretty clear on view of continuing to hold the core flat from here, but. I think an ongoing question is, just as we look further out, and I know there's no crystal ball here, like at what would you get a line of sight when that next wave of gross saves related to all the duplicative and extras buildup in the infrastructure-related to risk compliance, etc. You see — when you get the line of sight of when you can start to sunset that, I know you talked about that as a big point of how you get the ROE up over long — over the medium-term.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, Ken, let me try to clarify a little bit of that, so I think when you look at what we talked about last quarter in terms of getting to a 15% ROTCE in the medium-term, that didn't assume that we would have to take out a significant amount of the costs related to the risk and regulatory buildouts that we're doing. And that efficiency on those — on those expenses will be out a little while. It could be — it could be years in terms of before we really get out some of that. So — but I think our focus is to get the return to a sustainable 15% in the medium-term by not having to rely on that. It really goes back to what we talked about really making sure capital gets optimized, not just in terms of shareholder return, but also across the balance sheet, requires us to continue to execute on efficiency initiatives outside of the risk and regulatory work and then we'll start to get the benefit of some of the investments we've been making now for the last couple of years.\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nAnd I'll just add to that just to be clear, when we think about the opportunities to continue to drive efficiencies in the company, we're not — we don't even think about all the expenses related to the risk and regulatory framework, work that we're doing, that work is — and those expenses are they're necessary and those are not excuse for us not to be efficient and everything else that we do. And so as we talked about in the consumer businesses a second ago, we look across all the things that we do and there still is significant opportunity to just become more efficient and either reduce the expense base or provide more capacity to invest going forward. And at some point, can we become more efficient in how we run the risk infrastructure of the company? Probably, but that's that's not on the radar screen and not necessary for us to achieve our efficiency goals.\nKen Usdin — Jefferies — Analyst\nYeah, and thanks for those clarifications. One, just a question on the fee side. I know watching your trading results are a lot different than watching some of the bigger peers. But just looking at that $1.3 billion [Phonetic] on the face of the income statement this quarter in the context of the environment, can you help us put that into context. Is that just exceptional result this quarter, did it have anything we should be mindful of as we think forward and just your general outlook?\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nThank you. Yes, sure. We certainly benefited from the volatility that we saw particularly in the rate market and other — some of the other asset classes in the quarter. And you can see that in the results, but when you look at some of the core platforms in FX and other areas, we've been just consistently investing in some of those platforms. So hopefully, over time you'll see good results there, but the quarter definitely was influenced by the volatility that we saw across the market.\nKen Usdin — Jefferies — Analyst\nOkay, thanks very much.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open.\nEbrahim Poonawala — Bank of America — Analyst\nHey good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the capital comments. I guess, Charlie, you talked about this, is it fair for us to assume, clearly, we have the SCB coming out of the stress test, that'll be one data point. And then the Basel reforms. Should we assume that the cap CET1 likely drift higher, maybe 11%, maybe higher in the near-term, while you still buy back stock, is that a right assumption? And secondly. I think Mike you mentioned about optimizing for capital and RWA, just maybe if you can call out a few things that you can do to optimize RWA relative to where the balance sheet is today?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, sure, thanks. I think the simple answer to your first question is, no, we don't expect that to continue to keep drifting up. Certainly, we'll find out the results of CCAR with everybody else in June. And then we've got Basel IV, which is a little bit longer timeline than that. But we're 160 basis points above the regulatory minimum buffers. We've got plenty of capital to deal with whatever comes out of that and as we said over time, we'll get closer to 100 basis points or so above those — above the 9.2% and so I think there's plenty of capacity to deal with whatever comes and continue to return money back to shareholders, as Charlie said. The —\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nSo I think this is the second part — and again all I was trying to say is we have — we have a lot of flexibility to deal with things that come our way. And so we're not anticipating significant additional capital needs. We're not anticipating that any potential downturn could create additional capital needs side of the business. All we're saying is that, if anything, of those things were to happen, we have the flexibility to deal with that both because of the amount of earnings that we have, as well as the existing excess capital that we have. So you add those, you take that you say, we bought all those things happened while we bought $4 billion stock back this quarter. So we feel we'll be able to continue to return capital and still maintain a very conservative position.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, and then just to give a couple, like example to help illustrate the capital optimization, the mortgage business is one of them, if we want mortgage exposure, we can buy securities, you don't have to always hold the mortgage. If you're buying securities, you don't have to buy UMBS, you can buy Jennies. And so there's plenty and then you can look at each of the underlying portfolios and make sure we're getting the return from a relationship point-of-view that we think, whether that's in the commercial bank or the corporate investment bank and so I think there is a plenty of areas that we can either reallocate capital to clients that we think will get better returns for or optimize some of the underlying portfolios.\nEbrahim Poonawala — Bank of America — Analyst\nGot it and just one separate question, you made tremendous progress, Charlie, since taking over on the compliance risk management front, there was a news article last night talking about some OCC MRAs. I don't expect you to comment on that, but can you give us a sense from a shareholder perspective, your level of confidence around the risk of another shoe dropping and major setback to all the efforts and actions that you've taken to adjust the regulatory orders to the extent you can, just to give comfort that the progress that's been made is getting us closer to the finish line as opposed to another big setback, that could push us back again.\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nYeah, listen I. I would refer you back to my shareholder letter, where I wrote about it extensively, and I think it still continue to feel exactly the way we felt when we wrote that letter, it wasn't that long ago, which is, we have continued to work to do, feel very confident in our ability to get the work done and that we're making progress and so we live in an environment where things can come up. That's always the case. So we don't want to pretend like there are no risks of other things out there, but if there was anything specific, we would do our best to let you know and we feel good about the progress that we're making and are extremely focused on making sure that we've got all the attention decked against it, but we're confident that the things that we're doing will close the gaps that exist in the company when we got here.\nEbrahim Poonawala — Bank of America — Analyst\nNoted. Thank you very much.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari — Evercore ISI — Analyst\nGood morning. On the — back to the NII drivers, can you maybe give us an updated expectation on how you're thinking about loan growth here as you look through 2023. I know you cited some of the pressures on the consumer side, but turning the table will turn school in commercial. And then separately on the deposit side, you have an updated expectation regarding your total deposit beta as you see pricing pressure continue?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, thanks. So on the loan side. I think we're definitely seeing pockets of growth in places like the commercial bank and that's been pretty consistent now for a couple of quarters. It's not — but the overall growth rate across total loans has moderated for the last three quarters which is exactly what we thought might happen when we are talking last last summer and so I think it will still be pretty moderate. I wouldn't expect huge growth in loans over the rest of the year and embedded in our guidance is some low-single digit growth rate in terms of loans for the year. And so I think — I think that's what we're assuming there. What was the second part again, john, sorry.\nJohn Pancari — Evercore ISI — Analyst\nYeah, it was around updated deposit beta —\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nDeposit beta, sorry. Yeah, no, look on the deposit side, to date, betas have played out almost exactly of what we thought — how we thought they would. And I think from here, the path of rates will matter, competition will matter. And so as I mentioned earlier in the call, we're still assuming it's going to be pretty competitive when we give you the guidance that we gave you. And I think we may find that hopefully that it gets that maybe we're being a little conservative there. But we do think at this point, it will still be competitive. And I think the betas will be pretty reasonable though on the consumer side, when you look back after the rates rise stop.\nJohn Pancari — Evercore ISI — Analyst\nGot it, okay. Thanks, Mike. And then separately on the commercial real estate front, maybe if you could just elaborate a little bit on the stress that you're seeing. I know you discussed office, maybe can you talk about your LTVs in office maybe on a refresh basis GAAP and have that maybe in other portfolios as well, because clearly the change between origination LTVs versus where we're seeing refresh levels come in are clearly what is motivating some of the impact around reserve behavior. So if you can give us little color there, that'd be helpful.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, sure, look, in the office space right now, as as many others have said too, like this is going to play out over an extended period of time, we're not seeing a lot of near-term stress in terms of what — whether clients are current or seeing very big issues on a property-by-property basis at this point, but we do expect some of that to come. And I think it will be for all the reasons that you know everyone's reporting on, right, and in particular, it will be in cities that you see weakness in places like San Francisco and LA, a little bit in Seattle. And so it's all the places where either lease rates are already lower than the national average or the secular changes around back-office are changing a little bit more of a bigger way. And — but it's going to take time and we just haven't seen it translate into lost content here and we're going very granular property-by-property. And so, giving you LTV numbers from a portfolio at a portfolio basis, really isn't that helpful at this point. Because it really is going to be a matter of, like what each of these underlying properties look like and what the issues are there. And we haven't seen a lot of trades happening either recently and so that also will impact how you think about the valuations and what we're doing is really just making sure we stress it in a whole bunch of different ways on a property-level basis to make sure we understand where the potential issues might come from.\nJohn Pancari — Evercore ISI — Analyst\nOkay, thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck — Morgan Stanley — Analyst\nHi, good morning.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nHow you're doing.\nBetsy Graseck — Morgan Stanley — Analyst\nCouple of questions. Little bit of follow-up, but one on the credit side. Wanted to just understand a little bit about the recoveries in commercial. I know in the deck, you mentioned that commercial loans yields were down in part due to higher recoveries and just wanted to understand how long you see those recoveries persisting and was there — is there any driver for them actually increasing from here? Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, there really isn't any story there. Betsy, well. I mean we get recoveries every quarter and there really isn't a significant trend change one way or the other. And again, it's going to come back down to individual underlying issues or situations that drive it quarter-to-quarter. But I wouldn't read too much into the trend.\nBetsy Graseck — Morgan Stanley — Analyst\nOkay, and then separately on the wealth deposits. I know earlier in the call you addressed this that you would expect to see the wealth outflows continue at current pace or so for at least a little bit of time. I'm wondering, is there any anchor that you can give us with regard to whilst deposits as a percentage of client assets that existed pre-COVID that maybe we should anchor back on in modeling that line-item.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. I mean, what we gave you in my commentary was just cash as a percentage of assets. And it's quite a bit higher than it was before. I know about 12% now versus 4% and obviously deposits is going to be a sub-component of that and there are other drivers, right, of how much cash, people are gonna hold as a percentage of assets in and right now, you're seeing a lot of — a lot of what. Is going into cash also is coming out of other asset classes. So it's not — so it's a little harder to give you a specific number of like deposits as a percentage of assets, because you're seeing people sell equities and other asset classes and drive up those cash balances,\nBetsy Graseck — Morgan Stanley — Analyst\nRight. And cash for you is, it's including things like MMF and treasury bills, things like that.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nAbsolutely, yeah.\nBetsy Graseck — Morgan Stanley — Analyst\nOkay —\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nAnd so I would just take that the current balance that you see in the wealth space and the deposit side and assume that continues to come down at a pretty — at a stable pace for a little bit.\nBetsy Graseck — Morgan Stanley — Analyst\nAnd then just last question here on deposit betas. I know you indicated that they should be okay. I guess I'm wondering how you think about deposit betas this cycle versus last cycle, similar, higher or lower, any sense as to versus prior cycle in magnitude would be great. Thanks.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah, look. I mean, it will be different, obviously. And part of what's going to drive that is how long rates stay higher. And I think that will — that's we'll find that out over a period of time, but as you can tell where betas have performed so far they performed pretty well when you look at it relative to the last cycle, particularly given how far rates have moved up in excess of what happened last time. And so — and they're behaving exactly as you might think, right. And if you go portfolio by portfolio, the betas are pretty high on the corporate — large corporate side. That's been the case now for a couple of quarters, they're a little bit lower in the commercial bank given the nature of that client base. And in the consumer side, they're relatively low given the amount of rate rises that we've seen so far. And so I think on the large corporate side, you will see those be pretty consistent from here. And the consumer side will be a function of all the things we talked about earlier.\nBetsy Graseck — Morgan Stanley — Analyst\nGreat, thanks so much.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Connor — Deutsche Bank — Analyst\nGood morning. I was hoping you guys could elaborate on the slowing consumer spending towards the end of the month? Any more color there and any thoughts on what's driving that?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nYeah. It was pretty small when you look at that change. So I wouldn't read too much into it. I think people are still — there's still a lot of activity out there and consumers are still out spending both on the debit side and the credit side. So, I wouldn't read into a couple of weeks.\nMatt O'Connor — Deutsche Bank — Analyst\nOkay. And then separately, I know I always kind of harp on some of these reg issues. And I appreciate the New York Post article yesterday, you can't comment specifically on. But it did allude to some concerns in your trading business. And obviously, it performed extremely well. You've been growing it, although I don't think you're growing it super aggressively. But there's been some political comments, maybe it was, I don't know, six months ago or so, that you shouldn't be growing your capital markets business, while you're investing in these other areas. So I guess maybe you could just address the trading businesses overall in terms of how you're growing them in a responsible way and how you're making sure the oversight of risk management is fine. I mean because, again, externally, it seems like everything is going really well, but there is — it's hard to tell. Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nWe have no concerns over what we're doing in the business. We're not increasing risk in any meaningful way. We've had strong oversight in that business, and we think it continues. And we benefited from business activity, which is focused on customer flow. We have strong financial risk management in the company and have had that for a long period of time. We have strong risk management over our trading businesses and controls. And I would just be really careful to take the source that you're taking and using that to expand into anything beyond from whence it came. If it was anything meaningful to report, we report it. And as I said, we feel really good about the progress that we're making, and we feel good about the performance of the company. And I think it's that — that stands on its own.\nMatt O'Connor — Deutsche Bank — Analyst\nOkay. That's very clear and very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy — RBC Capital Markets — Analyst\nThank you. Hi Mike. Mike, you talked about some of the reasons why your commercial loan growth was quite strong on a year-over-year basis. Can you share with us, are you guys seeing any reintermediation where the DCM market was very weak in the quarter for the industry, it was weak last year. Are you guys seeing benefits from that where people are — corporate and commercial customers are coming to you using your balance sheet more so than possibly a year-and-a-half ago?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nNot in any meaningful way. There's always an anecdotal story, I'm sure, out there, but I wouldn't say it's meaningful.\nGerard Cassidy — RBC Capital Markets — Analyst\nVery good. And then, as a follow-up, I know you gave us some details about the net interest income growth this year. They're still being [Technical Issue] annualize the first quarter results —\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nHey Gerard, we lost you there for a second. Can you just repeat the whole second part?\nGerard Cassidy — RBC Capital Markets — Analyst\nSure. You gave us some details on the outlook for net interest income growth, up 10%. And if you annualize your first quarter number, of course, that's — that would be greater than the 10% growth for the full year. And you gave us the reasons why there's a lot of uncertainty. The one specific question though is, has your thinking on the yield curve and I know this is very hard. Nobody can predict where it's going to be. But are you thinking that the yield curve and maybe a rate cut could be coming sooner and the yield curve comes down when you look at your outlook, or has your outlook for the interest rates changed, I guess, is the question.\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think certainly, the market expectations are implying that there will be a decrease in the late part of the year. And so, I think that's certainly being priced in at the moment. But I do think that you need to be prepared that that's not going to happen. And I think it's possible it doesn't. So, I think as we get a little closer, you'll — we'll all know. And what we try to do in our guidance is use what the market is telling us, right? So, if that doesn't happen, there's — and rates are higher than what the market is implying, then there will be a little upside there.\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nYeah. And the only thing I'd add is, listen, in all of this, there's — I tried to say this in our remarks, which is we've said constantly, we don't know what the future holds. We see what the market is saying. Who knows where the market is right or wrong. You have the Fed chair who's talking about expect rates higher for longer. And so, we're prepared for a range of scenarios. When we think about giving guidance, we just try and choose a benchmark, which is the market, which is it's a scenario and pick your own scenario based upon what you all think and you can make your own determination what it will be, but we're just trying to give you both like a benchmark and what supports that benchmark, but also be clear that there are a range of alternatives out there, which could make the result differ, just trying to be as apparent as we can.\nGerard Cassidy — RBC Capital Markets — Analyst\nNo, I appreciate the further insights. This is very helpful. Thank you.\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nSure.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from David Long of Raymond James. Your line is open.\nDavid Long — Raymond James — Analyst\nGood morning, everyone. I appreciate all the color on some of the deposit flows. But let me just ask it in a little different way. From a noninterest-bearing deposits figure, the number, the percentage has come down, how do you expect that concentration to change over the course of the next several quarters?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I wouldn't try to predict it exactly over the next couple of quarters. But I think if you look at — we're about 32% in the quarter. And if you go back a number of years, pre-pandemic, that was in the mid-20s. And so — so it could — and we've said this in other forums that you could see it start to trend towards there. Will it get down there? Unknown, but I think you'll see it trend down a little bit more.\nDavid Long — Raymond James — Analyst\nSure. If you look back over, call it, the last 15 years since the great financial crisis, rates have been pretty close to zero outside of brief periods, just before the pandemic. Do you see noninterest-bearing deposits going back to pre great financial crisis levels for Wells Fargo or the industry where we had numbers there in the mid to high teens?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nI think that's almost impossible to predict.\nDavid Long — Raymond James — Analyst\nGot it. Okay. Thank you. Appreciate it.\nOperator\nThe last question for today will come from Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer. Your line is open.\nChris Kotowski — Oppenheimer — Analyst\nGood morning and thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wonder, how do you anticipate managing the duration of your investment securities portfolio from here? I mean, obviously, it must have extended out quite a bit last year. And we saw the mark-to-marks on it increase across the industry. But I noted kind of the HTM portfolio is down about 7% during the quarter. And I mean, do you anticipate running that down? And if so, how quickly does it run down if you do nothing?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nWell, I think, obviously, that's going to be a little bit dependent on rates and where rates go, given there's some mortgages — mortgage securities in the portfolio in terms of the burn down. And I think we're going to continue to be thoughtful as we have in the past around thinking about the size of the portfolio in total, including the AFS. And that's really a function of a bunch of things, including how much loan growth we expect to see over a period of time. And then, we look at all of the other constraints that we've got to worry about around liquidity and everything else, and we decide on how much goes into HTM and what the makeup of it is. But at this point, we feel comfortable with the quantum and both in terms of the size of the portfolio and the duration of portfolio.\nChris Kotowski — Oppenheimer — Analyst\nOkay. So, you anticipate keeping it roughly the size, all things being equal, or does it run down?\nMike Santomassimo — Chief Financial Officer\nI think we'll make that decision over time. I don't anticipate the portfolio getting much bigger from here over the next few quarters, but I think we'll make that decision over time. And then, the burn now will be what it is based on where rates and natural maturities of the portfolio go.\nChris Kotowski — Oppenheimer — Analyst\nOkay. Thank you. That's it for me.\nCharlie Scharf — Chief Executive Officer\nAll right. Everyone, thanks so much. We appreciate it. And we'll talk to you soon. Take care.\nOperator\n[Operator Closing Remarks]"}
{"date": "Apr 12, 2024, 10:00 a.m. ET", "exchange": "NYSE: WFC", "q": "2024-Q1", "ticker": "WFC", "transcript":"Prepared Remarks:\nOperator\nWelcome, and thank you for joining the Wells Fargo first-quarter 2024 earnings conference call. [Operator instructions] Please note that today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, director of investor relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nGood morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss first-quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our first-quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement, and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com.\nI'd also like to caution you that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings, including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials. Information about any non-GAAP financial reference, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I'll now turn the call over to Charlie.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nThanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our first quarter results and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review our results in more detail before we take your questions. Let me start with some first-quarter highlights.\nOur solid results reflect the progress we're making to improve and diversify our financial performance and the continued strength in the U.S. economy. It's gratifying to see the investments we're making across the franchise contributing to higher revenue versus the fourth quarter, as an increase in noninterest income more than offset an expected decline in net interest income. Noninterest income also benefited from higher equity markets, which benefited our Wealth and Investment Management business.\nNet charge-offs were higher than a year ago as expected and stable from the fourth quarter. Credit trends remain generally consistent. Consumer delinquencies continue to perform as we've forecasted, and year-over-year growth in consumer spend remains consistent with prior quarters. In our commercial portfolios, the weakness we see continues to be in certain commercial office properties, but our expectations have not significantly changed versus what we anticipated last quarter.\nMike will discuss the specific items that drove an increase in expenses from a year ago, but we continued to execute on our efficiency initiatives, including reducing headcount, which has declined every quarter since the third quarter of 2020. Average commercial and consumer loans were both down from the fourth quarter as higher rates are impacting demand and we are continuing to reduce our exposure in certain portfolios. Average deposits were relatively stable from the fourth quarter as growth in interest-bearing deposits offset lower noninterest-bearing deposits. Our capital position remains strong and returning excess capital to shareholders remains a priority.\nAs we stated on our last earnings call, we expect to repurchase more common stock this year than we did in 2023. In the first quarter, we repurchased a total of $6.1 billion in common stock, and our average common shares outstanding declined 6% from a year ago. Now let me update you on the progress we're making on our strategic priorities, starting with our risk and control work. Earlier this year, the OCC terminated a consent order issued in 2016 regarding sales practices misconduct.\nThe closure of this order was an important milestone as it is confirmation that we operate much differently today around sales practices. As I repeatedly said, our risk and control work remains our top priority, and closing consent orders is an important sign of progress. This is the sixth consent order that our regulators have terminated since I joined Wells Fargo in 2019. Building our risk and control framework is a continuous ongoing effort, and as we implement changes, we track effectiveness along the way.\nThe numerous internal metrics we track show that the work is clearly improving our control environment, and we see that we are completing interim deliverables, but we will not be satisfied until all of our work is complete. So it will remain our top priority and our approach will not change. As I highlighted in my recent annual letter, we have added approximately 10,000 people across numerous risk and control-related groups, and we're spending over $2.5 billion more per year than in 2018 in these areas, and we are a stronger, better company for our customers, communities, and employees. While we're moving forward with confidence, I will repeat what I've said in the past.\nRegulatory pressures on banks' long-standing issues such as ours is high. And until we complete our work and until it is validated by our regulators, we remain at risk of further regulatory actions. Additionally, as we implement heightened controls and oversight, new issues could be found and these may result in regulatory actions. At the same time, we're making progress on our risk and control work, we're executing on our strategic priorities to better serve our customers and help drive higher returns over time.\nWe continue to introduce attractive new products as we build our credit card business. Last month, we launched Autograph Journey, designed for frequent travelers who could earn points wherever they book travel. Our new product offerings continue to drive strong credit card spend, up approximately $5 billion or 14% from a year ago. We continue to make investments in talent and technology to strengthen Corporate and Investment Banking.\nMore than 50 new senior hires have joined our CIB since 2019, with many of these in key coverage and product groups within banking. In February, Doug Braunstein, who has more than 35 years of industry experience, joined Wells Fargo as a vice chairman. Doug is a world-class banker, and he's working alongside the great team he's assembled to continue to grow the franchise. In addition, given the breadth of Doug's experience, he's also providing counsel on broader business issues beyond client development.\nAs we look forward, it's always helpful to be grounded in the facts. We continue to see strength in the U.S. economy. Spending patterns of consumers using our debit and credit cards remain generally consistent and continue to grow year over year.\nConsumer credit is performing as we expect, wholesale credit continues to perform well, and our views around commercial real estate have not significantly changed since last quarter. These are all positives. In addition, we remain committed and confident in our ability to increase efficiencies across the enterprise. And areas we have targeted for investment such as credit card, investment banking, and trading are performing well.\nWe are beginning to see early signs of share and fee growth, which will be important as we diversify our revenues and reduce net interest income as a percentage of revenue. And we remain bullish on opportunities across our other businesses, again, more positives. Having said that, markets and rates will likely remain volatile. And as risk managers, we are prepared if trends were to change.\nWe've historically managed credit through multiple cycles and believe that the actions we've taken over the last several years position us well. We have strong capital and liquidity positions. As we're building many of our businesses, we have done so within a consistent level of risk appetite. And our business model and franchise value differentiates us from most of who we compete with, regardless of the environment.\nSo what does all of this mean for our outlook? Simply said, our views haven't changed from last quarter. While we could look at specific data points on a specific date and alter our guidance, there is not enough of a consistent pattern to change our views, but what we see is helpful. Our focus remains the same. We are transforming Wells Fargo and are investing to build a well-controlled, best-growing and higher-returning company while we work to become more efficient.\nI'm pleased with the progress we've made, and I'm optimistic about the future opportunities ahead. I will now turn the call over to Mike.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nThank you, Charlie, and good morning, everyone. Net income for the first quarter was $4.6 billion or $1.20 per diluted common share. Our first quarter results included $284 million or $0.06 per share for the FDIC special assessment as a result of the regional bank failures last year. Recall last quarter, our results included $1.9 billion for the special assessment, and this additional amount reflects recent updates provided by the FDIC, including potential recoveries, which were highlighted in their disclosure.\nThe ultimate amount of our special assessment may continue to change as the FDIC determines the actual losses and recoveries to the deposit insurance fund. Turning to Slide 4. Net interest income declined $1.1 billion or 8% from a year ago due to the impact of higher interest rates on funding costs, including the impact of customers migrating to higher-yielding deposit products as well as lower loan balances, partially offset by higher yields on earning assets. First quarter results were largely as expected with loan balances a little lower and deposit balances in the businesses a little higher than our expectations.\nOur full-year net interest income guidance has not changed from last quarter, and we still expect 2024 net interest income to be approximately 7% to 9% lower than 2023. We also continue to expect net interest income will trough toward the end of this year. It is still early in the year and, ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earn will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including deposit balances, mix and pricing, the absolute level of interest rates, and the shape of the yield curve and loan demand. On Slide 5, we highlight loans and deposits.\nAverage loans were down from both the fourth quarter and a year ago. Credit card loans continue to grow, almost other categories declined. I'll highlight specific drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 69 basis points from a year ago to over 6%, reflecting the higher interest rate environment.\nAverage deposits declined 1% from a year ago, reflecting lower deposits in our consumer businesses, as customers continued spending and reallocating cash into higher-yielding alternatives. While growth in average deposits from the fourth quarter was modest, we have grown deposits in our commercial businesses for two consecutive quarters, which reflected our success in attracting clients' operational deposits. Period-end deposits included in the chart on the bottom of the page were up 2% from the fourth quarter, but some of this growth reflected a temporary increase driven by a quarter end that was on a payday and a holiday. While the pace of growth slowed, our average deposit costs continued to increase as expected, rising 16 basis points from the fourth quarter to 174 basis points with higher deposit costs across most operating segments.\nOur mix of deposits continue to shift with our percentage of noninterest-bearing deposits declining to 26%. Turning to noninterest income on Slide 6. We were pleased with the growth in noninterest income across all of our business segments. Growth in noninterest income more than offset lower net interest income, reflecting a revenue growth from both the fourth quarter and a year ago.\nNoninterest income was up 17% from a year ago with strong growth in investment advisory fees and brokerage commissions, deposit and lending-related fees, trading and investment banking fees. As Charlie highlighted, we benefited from market conditions as well as the investments we've been making in our businesses. I will highlight the specific drivers of this growth when discussing the segment results. Turning to expenses on Slide 7.\nFirst quarter noninterest expense increased 5% from a year ago, driven by higher operating losses, the FDIC special assessment, an increase in revenue-related compensation predominantly due to higher investment and advisory fees in our Wealth and Investment Management business, and higher technology and equipment expense. These increases were partially offset by the impact of efficiency initiatives, including lower professional and outside services expense, which declined 10% from a year ago. The higher operating losses were driven by customer remediation accruals for a small number of historical matters that we are working hard to get behind us. The increase in personnel expense from the fourth quarter was driven by approximately $650 million of seasonally higher expenses in the first quarter, including payroll taxes, restricted stock expense for retirement-eligible employees, and 401(k) matching contributions.\nNot including expense for the FDIC special assessment in the first quarter, our full-year 2024 noninterest expense guidance is unchanged and is still expected to be approximately $52.6 billion. However, we continue to watch a couple of items. Our guidance included $1.3 billion of operating losses for the year, which we still believe is a reasonable estimate even with a higher level of operating losses in the first quarter. However, we have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact operating losses during the remainder of the year.\nAlso, if market valuations remain at current levels or move higher, that would increase investment in advisory fees and revenue-related compensation could be higher than we assumed in our expense guidance for this year, which would be a good thing. We'll continue to update you as the year progresses. Turning to credit quality on Slide 8. Net loan charge-offs declined 3 basis points from the fourth quarter to 50 basis points of average loans.\nCredit performance trends were consistent with what we saw last quarter. The decline reflected lower commercial net loan charge-offs, which were down $131 million from the fourth quarter to 25 basis points of average loans. The reduction was driven by lower losses in our commercial real estate office portfolio. We did not see further deterioration in the performance of our CRE office portfolio versus the fourth quarter and, therefore, our expectations have not changed.\nWe continue to expect additional losses in the coming quarters. However, the amounts will likely be uneven and episodic. Consumer net loan charge-offs continue to increase as expected and were up $28 million from the fourth quarter to 84 basis points of average loans. While auto losses continue to decline, benefiting from the tightening actions we implemented starting in late 2021, credit card losses increased in line with our expectations.\nNonperforming assets declined 2% from the fourth quarter, driven by the lower CRE office nonaccruals, reflecting the realization of losses and paydowns in the quarter. Moving to Slide 9. Based on the consistent credit trends I noted before, our allowance for credit losses was down modestly, driven by declines for commercial real estate and auto loans, partially offset by a higher allowance for credit card loans. The table on the page shows the allowance for credit losses coverage ratio for commercial real estate, including the breakdown of the office portfolio.\nWe didn't increase our allowance for this portfolio in the first quarter, and the coverage ratio in our CIB commercial real estate office portfolio of 11% was stable compared with the fourth quarter. Turning to capital and liquidity on Slide 10. Our capital position remains strong, and our CET1 ratio of 11.2% continue to be well above our 8.9% regulatory minimum plus buffers. We repurchased $6.1 billion of common stock in the first quarter.\nWhile the amount of stock we repurchase each quarter will vary, we continue to expect to repurchase more common stock this year than we did in 2023. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Consumer, Small, and Business Banking revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by our lower deposit balances. We continue to invest in talent, technology, and branches to improve the customer experience.\nOur branches are becoming more advice focused with teller transactions declining while banker visits have increased. We are modernizing and optimizing the branch network. The number of branches declined 6% from a year ago, while at the same time, we are accelerating the refurbishment of our branch network. In addition, the enhancements we are making to our mobile app continue to drive momentum in mobile adoption, and we surpassed 30 million active mobile customers in the first quarter, up 6% from a year ago.\nMobile logins also reached a milestone, surpassing 2 billion logins for the first time in the first quarter, up 18% from a year ago. Home lending revenue was stable from a year ago as higher mortgage banking income was offset by lower net interest income, as loan balances continued to decline. Credit card revenue increased 6% from a year ago, driven by the higher loan balances. Payment rates remained relatively stable compared with the fourth quarter and were above pre-pandemic levels.\nAuto revenue declined 23% from a year ago, driven by continued loans rate compression and lower loan balances. Personal lending revenue was up 7% from a year ago and included the impact of higher loan balances. Turning to some key business drivers on Slide 12. Retail mortgage originations declined 38% from a year ago, reflecting the progress we've made on our strategic objective to simplify the business as well as the decline in the mortgage market.\nWe also made significant progress in reducing the amount of third-party mortgage loans we service, down 21% from a year ago. We also continued to reduce the head count in home lending, which was down 33% from a year ago. Balances in our auto portfolio were down 12% compared to last year. Origination volume declined 18% from a year ago, reflecting credit tightening actions, but increased 24% from a slow fourth quarter.\nDebit card spend increased 4% from a year ago with growth in most categories, except for fuel and travel. Credit card spending remained strong. It was up 14% from a year ago. All categories grew with stronger growth in nondiscretionary spend.\nNew account growth continued to be strong, up 12% from last year. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle Market Banking revenue was down 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net interest income due to higher deposit costs, partially offset by higher deposit-related fees. Asset-Based Lending and Leasing revenue decreased 7% year over year and included lower revenue from equity investments.\nAverage loan balances were stable compared to a year ago as growth in Asset-Based Lending and Leasing was offset by declines in Middle Market Banking. Weaker loan demand reflected the impact of clients being cautious, given the higher rate environment and the anticipation of lower rates this year as well as some potential uncertainty in an election year. Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 5% from a year ago, driven by higher investment banking revenue due to increased activity across all products.\nOur results benefited from the areas where we have had strength for some time, such as investment-grade debt capital markets and from the talent we've been attracting into the business. While it is still early, we are encouraged by the green shoots we are seeing. Commercial real estate revenue was down 7% from a year ago and included the impact of lower loan balances. Markets revenue increased 2% from a year ago, driven by continued strong performance in structured products, credit products and foreign exchange.\nOur trading results continue to benefit from market conditions, and the investments we have made in technology and talent to round out the business have enabled us to produce strong results even as market dynamics have changed. Average loans declined 4% from a year ago. Banking clients have taken advantage of strong capital markets pay off loans. In addition to weak loan demand in commercial real estate given market conditions, balances also declined due to credit tightening actions we implemented last year, along with our efforts to actively reduce certain property types in the portfolio.\nOn Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue increased 2% compared to a year ago. Lower net interest income driven by lower deposit balances as customers reallocated cash into higher-yielding alternatives was more than offset by higher asset-based fees due to increased market valuations. While cash alternatives as a percentage of total client assets was higher than a year ago, it has declined in the past two quarters as the migration of deposits into cash alternatives has slowed significantly. As a reminder, the majority of WIM advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so first-quarter results reflected market valuations as of January 1st, which were higher from a year ago.\nAsset-based fees in the second quarter will reflect market valuations as of April 1st, which were higher from both a year ago and from January 1st. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Revenue grew from a year ago due to improved results in our affiliated venture capital business on lower impairments. In summary, our results in the first quarter reflected the progress we're making to improve our financial performance.\nWe grew revenue, driven by strong growth in our fee-based businesses. We continue to make progress on our efficiency initiatives. We increased capital return to shareholders and maintained our strong capital position. We'll now take your questions.\nQuestions & Answers:\n\nOperator\nThank you. [Operator instructions] And our first question will come from John McDonald of Autonomous Research. Your line is open, sir.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Guys, I wanted to ask about your profitability targets and kind of how you're seeing the journey to the mid-teens ROTCE goal. Mike, maybe you could talk about that through the lens of 12% return on tangible common equity this quarter.\nWhere do you think you're kind of overearning, underearning? And what does that journey to the mid-teens look like over the next couple of years?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nHey, John. It's Mike. Thanks for the question. So look, I think not much has changed in our thinking on the topic.\nAnd so as you sort of think about it on a long-term basis, there's no reason -- we still -- there's still no reason why our businesses shouldn't have returns like the best of our peers. And as we sort of go through that journey, obviously, we are where we are in terms of the returns today. And as we get toward closer to 15%, it's going to be the same kinds of drivers that we've been talking about now for a while. We've got to continue to optimize sort of capital and balance sheet.\nYou saw us return some via buybacks today. We're making investments on each of our businesses, and so we'll need to start seeing some of the returns there. And this was one quarter of it but a good quarter that shows some of the benefits of those investments we're making across a whole range of the businesses, which is good to see, and Charlie highlighted a bunch of that in his commentary. And then we've got to stay on the efficiency journey, which we continue to believe is not done.\nAnd we've got a lot of work to do to continue to drive efficiency across the company, and we're going to stay at that as we look forward. And so I think it's really those drivers that get in. We still have confidence that we're going to get there.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, John. It's Charlie. Let me just add a couple of things. Number one is just as a reminder to everyone, we tried to be clear as NII was rising and we got to certainly either at the peak or near the peaks that we were out-earning, and that we didn't look at those ROEs at those points as sustainable, but that our clear journey was to continue to get there on a sustainable basis.\nI think second of all, when we look at -- obviously, it's very hard to draw any conclusion from a specific quarter, right? You've got the FDIC. We've got operating losses, which we've talked about where our expectations are for the full year which are different than the quarter. So it's very hard to draw a conclusion on a specific quarter. But when we look at what is going to get us there, we are very consistent on what those things are.\nNumber one is improve business performance, and we tried to highlight where we see that. And those areas that we don't talk about are areas that we are still bullish on, but we'd like to see some more improvement and the ability to increase our returns in those parts of the company, as well as continued capital return as well as the limitations we have because of the asset gap. So again, our thesis hasn't changed, our views haven't changed and our confidence in getting there hasn't changed.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. And then one just quick follow-up there. Do you think this 11% CET1 is probably kind of the ballpark of where you hang out regardless of the minimum just because it feels like you have super regional banks that aren't G-SIBs that are running at 10%, 10.5%, you have bigger banks at 12%, 13%. Does 11% kind of feel like the right ballpark, which means you can return most of what you're generating now?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nI would say it's something that we continue to think through. You know our existing needs today with buffers are at 8.9%. At 8.9%, everyone understands that Basel III endgame is coming but likely with significant revisions. So I don't -- I think as the quarters continue, we'll learn more about where that will come out, and we'll be able to be more informed where we'll wind up.\nWe've always tried to be on the more conservative end, but there's a point at which too much is too much, which is why we bought the amount this quarter that we bought back.\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nOK. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala of Bank of America. Your line is open, sir.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nHey. Good morning. I guess just following up on that. As we think about Basel, your capital levels, even with 100 basis points buffer, you probably have $12 billion of excess capital.\nGiven what we saw in 1Q and I heard you, Mike, year over year, you're going to be higher but that doesn't give enough color. I'm just wondering, should we expect the pace of buybacks to continue, given that where the stock is trading, which is still fairly attractive valuations?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, it's Mike. Thanks for the question. As you look at the pacing, we're really not going to provide specific guidance on like what we'll do quarter to quarter. I think obviously, as you pointed out, we've got significant excess capital to where we need to be.\nWe'll be able to handle with whatever comes out of Basel III quite easily with where we are today, gives us the ability to be there and invest as we've got opportunities with clients. And so we've got lots of flexibility. And each quarter, we'll go through the same process we go through every quarter, which is thinking about sort of where the capital requirements are going to go, looking at all the different risks that are out there across the spectrum, whether it's rates or other, and then looking at what we're seeing from client activity. And then we'll make a decision on the pacing of it.\nBut as you say, we're still very confident we'll do more than we did last year, but pacing will kind of leave to -- we'll cover that each quarter after we report.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nGot it. And I guess just separately, I think there's a lot of focus on market share opportunity for Wells beating capital markets, IB, corporate lending, and I think Charlie referenced the hiring of Doug Braunstein. Would appreciate additional color in terms of areas where you see within corporate capital markets where there's market share to be had. And what's the level of investment/infrastructure needed in order for competing in that space and winning market share?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, let me start out. I think first of all, when we talk about the level of investment that's necessary, we're making the investment and it's embedded in what we're spending. And so we are funding that through normal course of business. Some of the folks that we're hiring or replacing other people and others are additions, but that's part of what it is.\nAnd so we don't anticipate any kind of step-up in the expense base to fund what we're doing, which we feel great about. We've got the ability to spend along the way and to actually see them paying off for itself. Listen, I said this very consistently, which is we are extremely underpenetrated across almost all segments of the investment banking space. But we've been stronger on the debt side.\nWe have not been as strong on the equity side. And by the way, all for reasons that relate to our own willingness to invest over the last decade and a half, not because of the opportunity or because of our business model, it's just the opposite. It's just not something that the senior management team here was supportive of, and we feel very differently than that. And so when we look across coverage in the equity space by industry, on the strategic side and how that relates to our -- the existing high-quality debt platform that we have, again, we're prioritizing industries based upon where we already have strength and relationship and where there are significant wallets.\nBut we feel really great about our ability to serve a broad set of customers and their desire to do business with us because of both the platform and the talent that we have here. And then when we look at our -- the trading side of our business, a big part of what we do there is to support our efforts within the investment bank. But it also is to leverage the broader institutional relationships that we have where we do a lot with those institutions, but we haven't necessarily leveraged trading flow as part of that. And so to do that, we're making investments not just in people but in technology.\nWe are -- as I alluded to, we're not doing any of this by rethinking the way we think of our risk tolerances. It really is about getting the right products, the right services, the right people, and calling on our customer base with a different degree of credibility and desire that we've had in the past.\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nSuch a great color. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Your line is open, sir.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThank you. Good morning. I'm wondering if we could talk a little bit about just that kind of last mile of deposit repricing. You talked about the mix shift and noninterest down and interest-bearing up.\nBut just wondering just what's happening on the pricing side. And are you still seeing both sides, consumer and wholesale? If you can maybe just kind of give us the dynamics that's happening underneath and how you expect that to continue as we get to this -- as we stay in this rates peak?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. I'll take that, Ken. As you look at the commercial side, not much has changed. It's pretty competitive.\nWe're not seeing it move one way or the other in a significant way as you sort of look over the last quarter. Good news is we've been able to attract good operating deposits in corporate investment bank. We've seen some growth in the commercial bank as well. And so all that's kind of performing as you'd expect.\nAnd you wouldn't really expect pricing to move there until the Fed starts to move. It will stay pretty competitive at that point. And we still expect betas to be pretty high on the way down as you start to see that eventually happen. On the consumer side, standard pricing is not moving.\nAnd really, what you're seeing is you're seeing people continue to spend some of the money that's in their checking accounts and/or move some of it into either CDs or higher-yielding savings accounts. And so you still see some of that activity happening across the consumer space and the wealth space, where you still have some people moving into higher-yielding alternatives. The pace of that migration has slowed at least for now. And so we'll see how that progresses through the rest of the year, but it has slowed a bit over the last number of months.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nOK. And on the lending side, I think what you guys showed is not unexpected at all based on general softness to start the year. So I think you and others have just kind of generically hope that we get an improvement. But with rates where they are, is there any impediment to just seeing an improvement in loan growth as the year goes on? Or is it baked into kind of the demand function that you're seeing underneath?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I think what we're seeing so far is exactly what we expected to see at the beginning of the year. And I know different people have different views back in January, but this is exactly what we expected, which is pretty low demand. Now as I said in my commentary, it's a little bit lower than what we had modeled but not substantially at this point.\nAnd it really is a demand function. When you look at what we're hearing from clients in the commercial bank or some of the clients in the corporate investment bank, they're looking -- they're being cautious still and saying, OK, I'm not going to build inventories as much as I might in a different environment. They're being thoughtful about the cost of credit and how that impacts investments they're making or the timing and the pacing of that. And so on the commercial side, it really is a demand issue at this point. On the consumer side, you continue to see some growth in card balances.\nGiven the size of the balance sheet, that's not going to move the whole balance sheet very materially, given where we start from. And then the mortgage side just continues to decline a little bit, given the market that we've got there. And in auto, we're seeing a little bit more decline, given some of the changes we made about a year and a half ago, one year, a year and a half ago on some of the credit tightening and eventually, that will start to turn. So I think those are the dynamics that we're seeing right now.\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nThanks, Mike.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Betsy Graseck of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nHey, Betsy.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nHey. OK. A couple of just quickies here. One is on the net interest income outlook that's unchanged, could you remind us what the interest rate environment is that's the base case for that analysis?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. It's Mike, Betsy. Welcome back. When you look at the environment, we're not guessing sort of what's going to happen, right? So I think as you sort of look at the different variables there, embedded in our baseline forecast is that we would expect somewhere around three rate cuts this year.\nAnd that's what's underlying sort of our thinking at this point.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nAnd was that the same as last quarter, same assumption set? Or has that changed at all?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nNo. I mean -- yes. No, look, it's definitely less than what I think was being projected by the market, and that's what we put out on our slide in January. And when you look at the impact of that, in isolation, you certainly would see a benefit from less rate cuts.\nBut I do think you have to put that in the context of, OK, now what's going to happen with client behavior and mix shifts as we look for the rest of the year? I mean it's certainly clear, we feel better today than we did in January about our guidance and our forecast there. But I do think we have to let some more time play out to see how people react to what's happening. And I think even you got to be really careful to take what happened over a day or two and extrapolate too far, right? We're seeing a bunch of that be given back today even. And what we've seen over the last couple of years is that every time you have this strong reaction, either up or down in expectation for rates, that reaction tends to moderate a little bit over a pretty short period of time.\nAnd so let's -- we'll see how that plays out.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. And anything -- and obviously, we've had quite a bit of activity, volatility on the long end of the curve. How do you think about that? And is there opportunity set for maybe pulling in some more deposits and reinvesting in securities, given the slightly improved long-end rates here?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, yes. And we've started to do that to some degree in the first quarter where we have been starting to buy some securities, mainly mortgages, given where rates and levels have been. And that's been a good trade, I think, for us so far. And so I think you'll certainly see us continue to deploy more cash into securities, at least at some modest levels as we look forward over the next quarter.\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks so much, Mike.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Erika Najarian of UBS. Your line is open.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning. Just to follow up on Betsy's questions. On the net interest income outlook, you had a peer that had a more modest upgrade to that outlook than expected.\nYou held firm on your NII guide. I guess to that end, as we think through whether or not there are going to be three cuts or no cuts, above and beyond just marking the market, the NII to the rate curve is the implication to volumes, right? Like you mentioned in response to Betsy's question, the client behavior. And so I guess I just wanted to understand in terms of the range of outcomes of zero, which is being talked about a couple of days ago with three embedded in your estimates, how should we think about how you're thinking about volumes in terms of loans and deposit behavior? In other words, have you considered a wider range of volume outcomes as you think about the curve outlook?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. No, I'll try to -- I'll take an attempt at that, Erika, and you can tell me if I covered it all. But it's certainly -- we're at a point in time, and I said this on a call with media earlier this morning, like we're at a time where it's difficult to sort of model the different outcomes that you could expect to see with net interest income, just given all the dynamics that are happening there. And as you said, like I think the fact that rates might be higher than what people expected a week ago.\nThat could change, first of all, but let's stipulate. At this point, people are thinking it's going to be higher for a little bit longer. We do have to wait and see how clients are going to react. And I think we do our best to try to come up with a range of outcomes there.\nAnd given that -- given what's happening in rates plus what's happening in quantitative tightening, what's happening in sort of the economy overall, it's going to all matter in terms of what happens with deposit levels. And let's see how that plays out. But I think as I come back to what I said earlier, we feel better than we did today than we did in January about where we are, but there's a lot to play out for the rest of the year.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nGot it. And just a follow-up, kind of a two-part question but hopefully very related to one another. It was -- the lifting of the consent order was clearly huge for how the market was perceiving Wells. As we think about further remediation, how should we think about how you're thinking about the potential cost saves that you could extract from all the processes that may be in place, has been focused solely on the remediation? And I ask that not in light of the usual recycled question, but clearly had a massive outperformance, like Ebrahim mentioned, on investment banking and trading.\nAnd as we think about those expenses, should we start expecting the reinvestment back to potentially accelerate? And also on investment banking and trading, I know there's a lot of seasonality, but are these new run rates? I guess it's hard for us to tell what the base is because obviously, as you -- as Charlie mentioned, you're underpenetrated across the board. So should we continue to see a moving up of this base despite the seasonality as we look forward?\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nOK. There's a lot in there. Let me start, Mike, and then you chime in. So first of all, Mike, you can comment on like investment banking and trading.\nBut again, we're not going to answer the question on how you should think about what investment banking and trading will be in the future. What we're focused on are, are we building businesses? Are we taking share in a way which is profitable? And that's exactly what we're starting to do. And there is volatility of the business, but we're focused on building it over a period of time, and that's what we're seeing. And so the way we would think about it when we look at our own forecasting is we would expect to see our market shares rise over a period of time, and quarter by quarter, know that it will be subject to volatility that exists.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nAnd when you think about the first quarter in particular, there's always going to be seasonality on the trading side. That happens pretty much every year, so you can't just take that as a run rate. And on the investment banking side, you've certainly seen some very high issuance volumes on the investment-grade debt side. So that's likely maybe pulling some issuance forward later in the year but we'll see.\nAnd then some of the M&A revenue that's embedded in there can be somewhat episodic and volatile, just given the timing of deals and closings and stuff. And so you do have to look at those 2 lines over a longer period of time.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAnd then on your question on expenses, again, it is -- we were in the exact same place that we've been, which is we're not thinking about at all. We're not doing work. We're not thinking about whether there are efficiencies to be gotten out of all the risk and control work that we're doing. In fact, we're still on the other side of that, which is we still have more open consent orders.\nAnd we're still committed to do whatever is necessary, including spending whatever is necessary to get that work done properly and build it into the infrastructure of the company. I've said there'll be a point at which when it's built into what we do and there's a high degree of confidence, that it is part of the culture and our processes, that we will have an opportunity to figure out how to do some of those things more efficiently. But that's not on our radar screen at all. What is on our radar screen is the fact that there's still a lot of inefficiency left within the company, completely away from the money that we're spending on this.\nAnd that's where we're focused, and that's why we have the ability to invest in card and invest in investment banking and trading and accelerate the branch refurbishments and hire more bankers in Commercial Banking and things like that. So I would just still continue to separate the fact that we're committed to get the work done, we're going to do whatever is necessary to spend there, and that's not the area of focus for us when it comes to efficiency.\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nThat was clear, Charlie. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Steven Chubak of Wolfe Research. Your line is open, sir.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nHi. Good morning, Charlie. Good morning, Mike. So I wanted to start off just on a question maybe unpacking the NII commentary a bit more.\nIn the prepared remarks, Mike, you noted that you expected NII to be troughing toward the end of this year. So less concerned about the full year '24 outlook. But I was hoping you could just speak to the inputs or assumptions that, that's supporting that expectation around troughing or stabilization, given further rate cuts that are reflected in the forward curve beyond '24.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. When you look at all the different factors, Steve, there's obviously nothing that's sort of unique to sort of our balance sheet. But when you look at both the asset repricing that's happening in securities, you look at what's happening and you just sort of project forward on sort of the loans and the other parts of the balance sheet, that's obviously a key input as you sort of look forward. And then at some point, you would expect that the migration and deposit mix starts to stabilize as you go forward.\nAnd I'm a little intentional -- I'm intentional in the words we use in terms of toward the end of the year. Is it right at this year? Is it early next year? Like it's going to be -- we're getting closer to that point in terms of when it's going to trough. Calling the exact date with a high degree of certainty is difficult in this environment. But it's all the things that sort of we've talked about over the coming -- over the last few quarters are going to drive that.\nAnd then it starts with like deposits and deposit mix and deposit pricing and then goes through the rest of where we think the assets sort of net out.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nThat's helpful color. And for my follow-up, might be regretting this question. But Charlie, it relates to how you responded to Erika's last one relating to the asset cap specifically. I recognize that you're focused internally on just addressing or remediating all the various consent orders.\nBut externally, investors are clearly spending much more time evaluating the different potential sources of earnings or return uplift once these regulatory restrictions are eliminated, whether it's deposit recapture, growth in trading book and reduction in that elevated risk and control spend. Don't expect you to quantify it, don't expect you to speculate on timing for when the asset cap can get lifted. But just given that focus for investors, it might just be helpful if you can contextualize how you're thinking about some of those potential benefits.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nSure. And I'm not sure you shouldn't feel like frankly ask the question, you get it? Or you should ask whatever you want. I just try to be as clear as I can on what I think we'll be in a position to answer, and I don't want you guys to get frustrated by the level of consistency of the things that we want to be careful about. But to your question, which is, I think, entirely reasonable, I'd put into a couple of categories.\nI think first of all, probably the most important thing with the asset cap, quite frankly, is not the pure economics at this point that will come from the lifting of the asset cap. It is still a reputational overhang for us. And while the lifting of the sales practices consent order was extremely important for those that have just read the newspapers, certainly, those that follow the stock care a lot about the asset cap and we understand that. And so that is just initially, I think, an important factor in terms of how we'll be viewed as opposed to what we'll actually do.\nI think when we look at what we have done to proactively manage the company to keep ourselves below the asset cap, there are two, you've got two categories. You've got places where we have gone and said, please make your business smaller just because of normal deposit flows and consumer business and things like that, we'll have some asset pressure and we need to offset at some place. And then there's the opportunity cost of what we haven't been able to do because we've had the asset cap, and then what does that mean going forward. On the first piece, we have limited our ability certainly within our trading businesses for some very low-risk things such as financing our customers and things like that.\nSo by not allowing them to provide a level of financing, which is very low risk, we have not captured as much trading flow as we otherwise would have seen. In our corporate businesses, we've been very, very careful to encourage our bankers to bring in sizable corporate deposits that weren't clearly operational deposits, and in some cases, been a little more aggressive about asking them actually not to have it here because we wanted to make room for other things that we thought were really important strategically such as not being closed for business on the consumer side, which those folks would not understand, is hopefully just something that's temporary. So those are the places that in the short term would benefit from the asset cap being lifted. I think when you get beyond that, the reality is when you look at what we've been able to do and the amount of excess capital that we have, we're trying to deploy that by -- through the dividend and through our share buybacks because there's only so much that we should keep around and not return to shareholders.\nBut we still -- as I talked about, we think there are plenty of opportunities when you look around our different businesses to achieve higher returns by reinvesting it inside the business. It's not anything which is -- I would describe it as dramatic. But in terms of the things that we can do when we don't have the constraints, take our -- whether it's our consumer business or our wealth business to build out our banking product set, to be more aggressive about being full spectrum in terms of where we are on the lending side and the deposit side. Across all of our businesses, we've been very, very conservative in what we have asked people to do because we don't want to have an asset cap issue.\nSo again, I would describe it as it's the -- it would be the ability to grow in the things that we're confident at that we do well, that we have, in some ways, consciously and in some ways, unconsciously restrained the company from doing. But all in all, certainly, without an asset cap, it's not a neutral. It's a positive because of the things that we proactively stopped as well as we're just limited in our ability to take advantage of the franchise that we have. And you've seen others that don't have those constraints but have the quality franchise as well, and you see how they benefited not just versus us but versus the broader banking set.\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nIt's really helpful context, Charlie. Thanks so much for taking my question.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nOf course.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from John Pancari of Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGood morning. On the 2024 NII guide, I understand that you feel better about the NII outlook here but you're watching customer behavior. I know you did mention loan growth. Did you lower your loan growth outlook that's baked into that guidance this quarter versus what you had in there last quarter? And either way, are you able to help us with what that expectation is on the loan growth front?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. John, it's Mike. What we said in January is that we expected loans to decline in the first half, and so that's about what we're seeing, right? So again, it's slightly lower than what we modeled, but it's pretty close to sort of what our expectation. And then we expect a little bit of growth in the second half of the year, and overall balances weren't going to do much for the full year.\nAnd so at this point, could we be off on that a little bit? Maybe. And could it be a little lower? Maybe. Could it be a little higher? Yes, for sure. And so -- but I think the more meaningful drivers this year of where NII ends up, it's going to come back to deposits, right? And what's the level? What's the mix? What's the pricing look like, given where the environment is? And I think that will be the more meaningful place to focus.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. And related to that, any deposit growth expectation that you could share?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I mean I think again, it's -- our full-year guidance that we gave you or assumptions we gave you in January, where we thought the commercial side would be pretty flat to where we are, to where we started the year, that's coming in slightly better than what we had modeled. In the consumer side, we would likely see a little bit of more decline as well as mix shift. And again, that's what you're seeing so far.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nListen, we just -- we want to be really careful in all this, right? We're not -- we're trying to be as transparent as we can be about what we're seeing without getting over our skis and making predictions that none of us have the answers to. And so like when you boil it all down in terms of the customer activity that we're seeing, a touch less here, a touch more there. There's not a big change from what we said three months ago in terms of flows on the deposit and the lending side. It really is relatively small relative to the big NII picture and what's going to drive NII at this point.\nSo if we saw big changes there, we might say, let's change guidance. But it's tweaking along the way and we'll see how it continues to pan out. And then what we said is relative to the rate environment, it's just -- again, it's -- this is a full year number and we've had a couple of months go by. It's just too early to mark the whole thing to market based upon that.\nBut again, we also wanted to just provide the context, as Mike has said and I said in my remarks, certainly, what we've seen is helpful relative to just the pure overall rate and curve piece of it.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nOK. That's very helpful. I appreciate the color there. If I could just ask one more along the credit side.\nNPA decline is encouraging there, and I know it can be volatile. Can you just maybe talk about NPA inflows? Did you see a pullback there? Did you see that on the CRE side? Is there anything to extract in that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. No, look, I think what you're seeing on the -- when you talk about commercial real estate, you're really talking about office. And what you saw in the office space is actually it not moved at all and get worse or not get worse in the quarter. And so you actually saw nonperforming assets not -- coming down a little bit in the CRE space as we've charged off some loans, and they weren't replaced by other items.\nAnd so that's a positive in the sense that it's not deteriorating at this point. And then everything else is sort of moving around like as you would expect. There's not substantial movements across the rest of the portfolio.\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nGreat. Thanks, Mike.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Matt O'Connor of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGood morning. I want to follow up on the comment that costs this year could come in higher on higher revenues, investment advisory, and I would assume the same if banking and trading continue to be so strong. Obviously, that's a net positive to earnings overall. But how would you frame the operating leverage if you can pick which revenue buckets? But if those market-sensitive revenues are $1 billion higher, is there kind of 40% cost against that, 50%? How would you frame that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. And really what we're referring to when we mentioned that is primarily in the wealth management business is where we're focused, given where market levels are. And that business is -- the cost-to-income ratio is pretty stable there in terms of the revenue-related comp. And so it's a little less than 50% in terms of how to think about it.\nSo the operating leverage is good.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nOK. That's helpful. And then just specifically on banking and trading, I mean, I know you guys invested in those businesses, so there's upfront cost when the revenues come. But it seems like the operating leverage in that segment has been very, very strong.\nAnd is that something that you think can continue if those revenues continue to surprise? Or could we see some upward pressure to cost from that, again, a positive to earnings overall but --\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. No, look, I think the cost to invest there, as Charlie noted, is in our numbers, right, so that's already there. So we're already anticipating that. And at this point, we don't see that being a big pressure point one way or the other.\nBut obviously, as you know, if revenues like far exceed our expectations in a positive way, that would come with a little bit of comp, too. So that would be a good thing overall.\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nYeah. Agreed. OK. Thank you.\nOperator\nThe next question will come from Gerard Cassidy of RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nThank you. Hi, Mike, Charlie. Mike, you touched on your noninterest-bearing deposits declined to about 26% of deposits. Do you guys have a sense what's the long-term normalization level for noninterest-bearing deposits as you look out over the 12-month horizon? Assuming rates do not go up, we have stable rates, maybe they come down a little bit.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look, I mean, it's a hard thing to say with a whole lot of certainty, Gerard, in terms of exactly where it's going to stabilize. It will stabilize at some point, particularly as you look at the underlying mix of the consumer deposit base, right? A good chunk of our consumer deposits are in accounts less than 250. They are generally operating accounts for a lot of people, and so this thing will stabilize as we go.\nBut as you've seen, we've had some pretty consistent, plus or minus a little bit, each quarter as we've gone through the last number of quarters. But at some point soon, that will start to -- we would expect that to stabilize, but we'll see exactly where it does.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nAnd is it fair to assume that the rate of change in the deposit betas is declining, where eventually those deposit betas flatten out as well?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Once you start seeing more stabilization in the mix, that's when you'll see deposit costs on the consumer side stabilize, right? Because what you're seeing now is people -- as I mentioned earlier, people are spending money in their checking account, low-interest cost for us. And then you're seeing growth in CDs and some of the savings accounts, which are higher cost. And that mix shift will stabilize.\nIt's very related to your first question around noninterest-bearing, right? Once -- they're kind of related together, right? Once you get to sort of that core operating balance in people's accounts, then that's when you'll see both of those stabilize.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. And then just as a follow-up on credit. Obviously, you guys put up overall good numbers and especially in that commercial real estate area, as you highlighted. Coming back to the credit cards, you pointed out that the charge-offs were up but in line with the expectations.\nAssuming the economy does not head into a recession later this year and unemployment goes up to 6%, say it stays around 4%, what are you guys thinking for like a peak in net charge-offs or credit cards? And when do you think you could reach that?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. Look, I think you got to really dig into the underlying dynamics of what's happening in the portfolio, right? We're in the middle of a refresh of our product set. We're seeing faster growth in new accounts and new balances coming on than maybe other players, just given the investments we've been making now for the better part of three years. And so that -- with that comes some maturation of the new vintages.\nAt some point, that should peak and you'll start to see sort of the normal behavior. But I'd just come back to, we spend a lot of time looking at each of the underlying vintages here. Everything is performing pretty much -- very much on top of what we would have expected or, in a couple of cases, maybe slightly better. And the quality of the new accounts we're putting on are -- the credit quality of them looks very good and continues to be the case.\nSo I would just say that we're in that normal phase of maturation. And as it sort of peaks, we'll sort of let you know when we sort of feel like we're there, but it should be coming over the coming quarters.\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nGreat. Thank you.\nOperator\nAnd the next question will come from Dave Rochester of Compass Point Research. Your line is open, sir.\nDave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst\nHey. Good morning guys. Appreciate all the color on the NII and loan trend outlook. I was just wondering on the loan side if you've noted any sensitivity at all in activity levels in general among your commercial customers to presidential elections in the past.\nAnd how big of a headwind, if any, you think that could be this year?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I mean that's hard. I think certainly, it will be a factor that people incorporate into their thinking of how aggressive or not they want to be in investments they're making. But at this point, that would be really hard to kind of prove out with any sort of empirical data.\nI think at this point, what we're seeing most is related to the overall sort of macroeconomic environment we're in with such high rates, and people having some uncertainty just generally around where things go from here. But I'm sure that will factor in at least to a small degree at some point as we go through the year.\nDave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst\nYes. OK, I appreciate that. And then just on the trading line, Matt had mentioned the momentum you've seen earlier. You obviously had a great year in trading last year.\nYou had your strongest quarter yet this year. And you've talked about making a lot of investments in the business in recent years. You're still making those now. It seems like you have a lot of momentum in this area where you could grow that this year as well despite having a huge year last year.\nJust wanted to get your take on all that.\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nWell, the environment is going to matter a lot. And so we've certainly been helped by some of the volatility that we've seen over the last four, five quarters. And so that could change the outcome quite materially for all of us in the industry and the trading line. So keep that in mind.\nBut as you said, we're continuing to make -- systematically make some investments there, and we feel good about that. And I think we continue to see some good performance from a market share point of view across those places we've been making the investments. But as Charlie also noted, we're somewhat constrained in some of those businesses. But we feel good about the progress that the team has made over the last couple of years.\nDave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst\nAll right. Great. Thanks.\nOperator\nAnd our final question for today will come from Vivek Juneja of J.P. Morgan. Your line is open, sir.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nHi. Thanks for taking my questions. A couple of questions. Firstly, financial advisors.\nCan you give some color on what those numbers have been doing over the past year, past quarter since that's not disclosed anymore? Are you building? What types of advisors? Experience is that new recruits from college. Any color, Mike?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes, sure. So as you pointed out, over the last -- if you go back a couple of years ago, and you definitely saw some declines that we were seeing in the advisor workforce. But Barry Sommers and team have been working really hard to sort of not only stem some of the attrition but also begin to really ramp up the recruiting again. And I think we're starting to see some of that come through.\nAnd so a lot of that -- we're back to like more normal, maybe slightly below normal attrition levels across the business, which is good. And we're feeling very good about our ability to recruit high-quality advisors. And so I think that trend you saw a couple of years ago was definitely different. And we'll continue to stay at it.\nWe're mostly focused on experienced advisors, a little less on, as you mentioned, college recruits and that type of thing.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nYes, the only thing -- listen, Vivek, this is -- I mean, we're recruiting -- I mean, it's across -- there's no one prototype here. We are -- we've recruited some of the biggest teams in the country that have traded over the last year and a half. And these are people that wouldn't have come to Wells Fargo before that because of the issues. And it was competitive and they chose to come here because of our capabilities, not because of what we're willing to pay them.\nAt the same side, we're staffing up in our bank branches and those are more entry-level people, people who come out of the banker workforce. And it's going to be across the board. But there's no doubt that the trajectory we have with our FA population is very different today than several years ago.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nOK. That's helpful. A completely different question, I want to go back to NII, not to beat the dead horse. But given that higher rates -- I mean, sorry, less rate cuts are better for you, if we -- so that should help NII now.\nBut if we see rate cuts and eventually in '25, does that mean that the troughing of NII could get pushed further back?\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nYes. I mean look, we'll see, Vivek, where it exactly troughs. Obviously, sort of the exact pace of rate cuts is part of the equation, but we also have to look at sort of the broader trends that we've talked about throughout the call, right? And how do depositors sort of react? Where does the mix shift stabilize? And how do -- what do we see from a competitive environment? So all of that matters as you sort of look at where exactly it's going to trough.\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst\nOK. Thanks.\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nAll right. Thank you, everyone. Appreciate it. We'll talk to you next quarter.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nJohn Campbell -- Director, Investor Relations\nCharlie Scharf -- Chief Executive Officer\nMike Santomassimo -- Chief Financial Officer\nJohn McDonald -- Autonomous Research -- Analyst\nEbrahim Poonawala -- Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst\nKen Usdin -- Jefferies -- Analyst\nBetsy Graseck -- Morgan Stanley -- Analyst\nErika Najarian -- UBS -- Analyst\nSteven Chubak -- Wolfe Research -- Analyst\nJohn Pancari -- Evercore ISI -- Analyst\nMatt O'Connor -- Deutsche Bank -- Analyst\nGerard Cassidy -- RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst\nDave Rochester -- Compass Point Research and Trading -- Analyst\nVivek Juneja -- JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst"}
