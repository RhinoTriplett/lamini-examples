Please proceed with your question.\nCarla Casella -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nHi. I'm wondering if you have any comments in terms of how high you're comfortable taking leverage in the event of M&A?\nNicholas Lahanas -- Chief Financial Officer\nSure. So we've been pretty consistent. Our optimal structure would be in that three to 3.5 times range. For the right deal, we'd be willing to lever up into the low 4s, and then quickly deliver back down to that three to 3.5 range.\nCarla Casella -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nOkay. Great. And then just given that retailers are better inventoried today and not chasing as much, are you starting to see any pickup in the promotional environment?\nTim Cofer -- Chief Executive Officer\nJ. D., you want to comment on Garden?\nJ. D. Walker -- - President of Garden Consumer Products\nSure. Hi. Carla, it's J. D. here. We're seeing some pickup in promotional activity versus prior year, but I would say that we're not back to pre-pandemic levels of promotion. So if last year -- I mean, last year, it went to practically zero. And this year, I'd say that in a range less than 50% of where they were in 2019 and before. So we're not back to that level yet. And I do think that, that has a pretty profound impact on our business model. Our business model is to trade that consumer off in the store, and that -- we rely on promotions and off-shelf activity. And I think that, that's hurt us somewhat over the last year, year plus. So we look forward to next year and beyond when it returns to normal levels.\nJohn Hanson -- President of Pet Consumer Products\nYes. And I'd say on the Pet side, very consistent. We're seeing a pickup in promotional activity, but it's nowhere near where it was pre-pandemic. And we look forward to accelerated activity in our Q1.\nCarla Casella -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nOkay.

We now expect net leverage to be below 3 times by mid-2021. Notably, net debt to total equity improved meaningfully in 2020.\nWe remain very comfortable with the substantial room we have in our covenants. As we have shared before, the terms of our net debt leverage covenant excludes the $400 million of senior secured notes. The covenant stepped down to 4.75 times at the end of 2020. We also have no short-term debt maturities as these are not due until October 2025 and October 2026. In terms of use of cash, our top priorities in the current environment continue to be to reduce our debt balance, manage leverage and preserve optionality for investing in future growth, while continuing to support our quality dividend.\nPlease turn to Slide 11 for a review of our outlook for 2021. Today, we are providing guidance for full year 2021, which reflects our best estimates and practical assessment of the financial impact of COVID-19 to Altra's businesses at this time. We are taking a cautious approach to our initial outlook for 2021, due to the ongoing uncertainties related to the duration of the pandemic and the timing of the economic recovery. While we assume that we will return to year-over-year growth, revenue growth in the first quarter, the guidance assumes that the general industrial economy will not begin to meaningfully recover until late in 2020. In addition, the guidance reflects approximately $40 million of cost savings realized in 2020 that will gradually phase back through 2021 with the full effect of the costs coming back by the second half of the year.\nAs a result, the guidance assumes that we will see SG&A expenses increase sequentially throughout the year. We also assume that China's demand in Class 8 truck will -- trucks will normalize in the second half of 2021. We are hopeful that market conditions improve sooner than our guidance currently assumes and we gain better visibility and as we gain better visibility, we will revisit our outlook as appropriate.\n====================\n\n\n====================\nThis is a section from an earnings call about company with ticker: DHI\nnces and liquidity than in prior years to support the increased scale of activity in our business and to provide flexibility to adjust to changing market conditions.\nOur homebuilding leverage was 16.8% at the end of March, was $2.5 billion of homebuilding public notes outstanding and no senior note maturities in the next 12 months. At March 31st, our stockholders' equity was $13 billion and book value per share was $35.96, up 25% from a year ago. For the trailing 12 months ended March, our return on equity was 27.1% compared to 19.1% a year ago.

This week, our Board of Directors authorized a new $1 billion stock repurchase authorization, replacing the company's previous authorization. The new authorization has no expiration date.

And we've been able to accelerate some share gains. Our printing -- RFID printing business was also particularly strong. And even the supplies business was doing very well.

Everything else, I would say was pretty standard. If you look at Q2 versus Q3, Q2 was very consistent linearity in booking and in Q3, we saw seasonal patterns that you would expect where August, given all the holidays. So, when you look at revenue contribution in quarter, Q2 was higher, right, because that was -- it was more front loaded and Q2 was more in the second and third months, so that was a little bit of an impact from that as well.

York?\nYork A. Ragen -- Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Aaron. Looking at fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in more detail, net sales increased 28.8% to $761.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2020, an all-time record, as compared to $590.9 million in the prior year fourth quarter. The combination of contributions from the Energy Systems, Mean Green and Enbala acquisitions and the favorable impact from foreign currency had an approximate 1% impact on revenue growth during the quarter. Net sales for the full year 2020 increased 12.7% to approximately $2.5 billion, also an all-time record for the company. Briefly looking at consolidated net sales for the fourth quarter, by product class, residential product sales during the fourth quarter increased 54.6% to $498.7 million, as compared to $322.5 million in the prior year. As Aaron already discussed in detail, home standby generator sales continue to experience robust year-over-year growth, which accelerated to over 40% during the fourth quarter as we made further progress increasing production levels for these products. In addition to this strength, shipments of PWRcell Energy Storage systems continue to significantly ramp during the quarter as the solar plus storage market expands at a rapid pace in the US and we continue to build out our capabilities selling into the clean energy space. Also contributing to the growth, were a large increase in shipments of portable generators during the quarter, which benefited from the much higher power outage activity as compared to the prior year. Lastly, shipments of chore products were also much higher during the quarter as the Home as a Sanctuary trend positively impacted demand for outdoor power equipment.

Non-GAAP revenue increased 22% compared with the third quarter of the prior year. This higher revenue was driven by a combination of new and existing customers using Green Dot products to electronically receive your income, elevated deposit balances from stimulus funds received in Q2, growth in our BaaS partner fees and accelerated demand for digital banking and payments products. We also started to see recovery in areas of our business that were negatively impacted by COVID-19. Our total operating expenses for the third quarter of 2020 increased by $42 million compared to the third quarter of the prior year, and our margins expanded by approximately 100 basis points. A big component of the increase in operating expenses was related to growth of our BaaS business.\nWe also had lower marketing expenses in the quarter. If you recall, Green Dot spent a majority of its full 2019 marketing budget in the second half of 2019. Finally, we had a few headwinds to margins, especially and increased revenue share with one of our key retail partners, higher transaction losses on our purchase volume and the timing-related expenses associated with incentive compensation for our employees. Moving on to our BaaS business. As we previously announced, we officially kicked off new relationships with Intuit and Kabbage in the third quarter, which further positions Green Dot to serve and Empower America's 30 million plus small businesses and entrepreneurs. Leveraging Green Dot's capabilities into it announced their plans to launch a QuickBooks cash account and Kabbage announced plans for Kabbage checking. We're also very excited about Kabbage's accelerated potential now that there are parts of American Express. Through these products, small business owners will now have access to more seamless, safe and value-driven banking and cash management for their businesses. We're incredibly proud to be a part of this movement, and look forward to deep\n====================\n\n\n====================\nThis is a section from an earnings call about company with ticker: PPG\nght years apart.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeff Zekauskas -- JPMorgan -- Analyst\nThanks very much. I think at the end of the last quarter you thought that you would earn between $2.15 and $2.20 a share. When did you realize that you wouldn't be able to do that? Was it something that happened at the very end of the quarter? Or at the middle of the quarter? And in your -- in net assessment of how much you might earn in the second quarter? What was the real sources of that? Was it an information issue? Or did it turn out that raw materials really rose very, very quickly in June? Can you talk about the history of the way you assessed the quarter -- over the past couple of months?\nVincent J. Morales -- Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer\nYes, Jeff, this is Vince. So if you look -- we came out early in April, we were one of the early reporters in April, it was directly after the weather event in Texas. At that point in time we were hearing from our suppliers and as Michael alluded to earlier, that this would be a multi-week start-up -- or we start-up as we progressed through the quarter and especially in June, we continue to see outages and escalation of raw materials, specifically in the June time period, which is why we're seeing Q3 higher than Q2 in terms of our raw material estimates. We continue to see outages, particularly around, transportation those outages continue to worsen, especially in June. And our customers continue to have spot production curtailments on their -- from their perspective.\nSo as we were in June, we continue to see the automotive market be heavily impacted by chip shortages and a lot of customers in that particular industry, who had earmarked Q3 for some downtime actually took it in Q2. So as we went through the quarter, we saw the difficulties continue to grow. So that really was the timeline.
