# Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

## Introduction

Language models may lack recent data and do not have access to your
private data, resulting in potential inaccuracies or hallucinations in the
repsonses.
That's where retrieval augmented generation (RAG) steps in, allowing users to
incorporate their data for more accurate and meaningful answers without
modifying the underlying model itself.
In this tutorial, we will show you how to use lamini's
`RetrievalAugmentedRunner` to attain high quality results.
